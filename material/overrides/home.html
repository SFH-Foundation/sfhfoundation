								<p>This website is the result of several years of sharing a way of life in our uncertain world with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures. This way reduces fear, suffering, and darkness and enables us to face difficulties and calamity with equanimity and grace. It has its foundation in awareness of – and constant calibration with – the eternal light of the soul within us, which is the source of all life. Awareness of eternal cosmic light will dispel much human discontent and provide hope that is beyond the limitations of birth and death. Our way goes beyond temporary notions of good and bad to reveal and revel in glorious divine presence – the purpose of human life.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Connect</h2>
								<p>We are living in a world where the challenges we face as humanity are increasingly complex. Yet, our continuous drive towards higher consciousness and the desire to connect with others and live meaningful lives remains constant.
									We hope to present here the understandable facets of reality and the dynamics of the forces in life, so that you can live a balanced existence, while experiencing higher consciousness. Every human being is a soul or spirit far greater than the limitations of the spacetime in which we must act.
