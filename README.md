# Welcome to the SFH Foundation

The goal of this archive is to provide a rich source of information about what we consider to be the optimum way of being. We use accessible language and the symbolism developed by Shaykh Fadlalla Haeri in order to present timeless prophetic teachings and relate them to the modern world.

Our intention is to open source knowledge that has previously not been available to the wider public. You can follow the website link above to access it, or run it yourself.
