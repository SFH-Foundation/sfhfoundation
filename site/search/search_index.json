The Academy of Self Knowledge delivers a range of dynamic courses, workshops and seminars in the journey of self-discovery. Universal, soul- stirring questions are addressed, such as: What is happiness? Does my life have a purpose? How can I find harmony in my relationships? What does it mean to be in connection with my soul? Is it possible to live joyfully in today\u2019s world? Founded in 2003 by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, ASK offers key principles which give us an insight into who we truly are, what motivates us and what hinders us from living our best life. Once we have been given these maps of the self, the challenge then lies in how to lead our lives in an optimal way that supports our growing consciousness. We are often aware of the desire to maintain our spiritual values, but find it difficult to navigate our way in a world that feels challenging. Unlike most courses, the ASK program not only gives you the knowledge base but also realistic applications by which you will experience real transformation in your life, building on the premise that knowledge alone is not power, but that applied knowledge has the power to transform. What ASK offers We offer \"maps of truth that will illumine the journey in this life and the hereafter\". The Academy has developed bespoke packages of learning that meet the requirements of specific groups and organizational needs. Currently we regularly run two types of intensive courses, either over a few months or over full weekend workshops. Both of these are highly participative, interactive and self-reflective to deepen one\u2019s understanding of our own real life experiences. For further information about the Academy and its activities, please send an email to ask@sfhfoundation.com .","title":"Academy of Self Knowledge"},{"location":"a-s-k/ask/#ask","text":"Now more than ever is a time to transform our consciousness.

Dhikr is the remembrance of God, from whom I am separated by my self. It is this illusion that is caused by me that is the cause of this barrier, separation. So it is a process of elimination. If I overcome the self, if I remove all of these images, all of these goggles that I have erroneously put on, then I am bound to be less separated from that which is the source of all beingness. So remembrance is necessary for us to begin to dissolve the self. If I remember God at the moment of agitation and disappointment, if I remember the Creator of the entire cosmos, from Whom this life is allotted for a few years, then my own little misery, my own problem, put in the large perspective, is bound to gain a measure of relief. It is bound to be a remedy for whatever situation I am in. Remembrance begins as an outside activity. Then it belongs to the heart. How can I remember God when I am full of me? When the bucket is full of me, there is no room for anything else. It is a displacement process. A bucket of pure water with mud particles in suspension can be purified again if we place it under a tap which drips into it fresh clear water. In time, this bucket of mud begins to get cleaner and cleaner and begins to reflect more of its real nature of pure water. Our nature is that of purity. That is why we like purity \u2013 we are basically pure at source. So there is no room for personal guilt. Our heritage is purity and the simplicity of beingness. But, because of the activities which we undertake in the world, we begin to solidify the roles and images into a personality with apparently conflicting and often irreconcilable aspects. It is by remembrance of God that I can begin to melt down the layers that I have created which are the source of my agitation, problems, and expectations. It is the most vital activity. A muslim prays five times a day, five formal and definable times for dhikr and salat (prayer). Five times to remember and submit to Allah, outwardly and inwardly. Fikr is that light which is shed on a scene in order to discriminate: what is good and what is bad, what is lasting and what is not, right and wrong, black and white. If we are in a state of real remembrance, then discrimination will operate spontaneously. Suppose we stop the moving film of our actions and freeze a frame. Dhikr freezes the \u2018frame\u2019 of action and fikr shines the torch of discrimination on it. Subsequent correct action will result from this. The film shows that I disliked your presence here to such an extent that I proceeded to punch you, and all of a sudden I see myself in this childish act, in the frozen shot of this film. If I catch myself in that instant, I am bound to discriminate and immediately correct the course. But we are often slow, and leave it too late. After I have done it I plead for forgiveness and say, \u2018It wasn\u2019t me!\u2019 What this means is that, after the event, I have had a replay of the act, because it was fresh in my memory, and in the light of discrimination. Neither remembrance nor discrimination will occur unless there is himmah \u2013 energy, yearning to be true, full, alive. The more we have this energy, the more it becomes available. It is like tapping a source: the more you clean the head of the spring, the more clear water will flow. But because we are accustomed to living in a manner that is totally incorrect and harmful, and which we try to persevere, we are scared of change and shut ourselves up in our private rooms. It is because we want to persevere habits. We are afraid of opening our hands to drop the thorns which we have clasped and made ours. But, when the pain is deep and real, then great yearning will enable us to act, drop the thorns and find the freedom that was there to begin with anyway. You may ask, \u2018if it is so easy, then what are all these methods for?\u2019 In a way, it is like picking up new thorns at will in order to get rid of the thorn that has been aching in you all these years \u2013 the old self. So there must be a beginning. The extent of new speed of the raft, floating on the stream of the past, depends entirely on the extent of the new energy in you. The greater the yearning and burning, the greater the energy. The greater is your suffering, the more you are qualified to free yourself from it. When fear is mild, one can brush it aside. When it is vast, new basic treatment is necessary and final cure is more probable. So the three basic requirements of the Path are entirely interrelated. Each of them reinforces the others, both in quantity and quality. If I have greater awareness, then more discrimination will constantly illuminate my actions. Therefore, more of my new actions will be such that they are not likely to enhance the self in me. Slowly, one observes the vanishing \u2018I\u2019-ness: arrogance, vanity, personality. So the outcome of the path towards self-knowledge is getting rid of the impermanent. Get rid of the \u2018I\u2019 and you will see the real self. It is a process of elimination. The embryonic seed of real knowledge is in everyone. But, in most cases, it has been tarnished or covered by the layers of the personality.

Ibn `Ata \u2018Allah exemplified the ultimate model of a Sufi master possessed of a deep foundation in the sciences of the Qur\u2019an, the way of the Prophet and the Universal Laws of the Islamic way of life, both outer and inner. Short but immensely thought provoking, dense in their significance and insightfulness, crisp and sharp in their elucidation, the aphoristic Hikam are a true manifesto for those who are sincerely on the path of knowledge and awareness. This wisdom strips away our conventional responses to events, actions and phenomena, and encourage us to concentrate on the only true Reality.

Etherscan is a block explorer, which allows users to view information about transactions that have been submitted to the blockchain, verify contract code, and visualize network data. This guide will focus on explaining the information that is displayed for different types of transactions on Etherscan. Components of an Ethereum Transaction on Etherscan Transaction Hash: A unique identifier that can be used to locate a specific transaction. Status: The current state of a transaction (Success, Failed, or Pending). Block: The block number that the transaction was included in. Timestamp: The time that the block was mined in UTC. From: The account that originally sent the transaction. To: The account that the transaction is addressed to. Value: The amount of Ether included in the transaction. Transaction Fee: The amount of Ether paid to the miner for processing the transaction, which is calculated by multiplying the amount of gas used by the gas price. Gas Limit: The upper limit of how much computational work and storage the sender is willing to expend on the transaction. Gas Used by Transaction: The amount of computational work and storage used in the transaction. Gas Price: The amount of Ether per unit of gas the user is willing to pay for the transaction, commonly denoted in a subunit of Ether known as Gwei. 1 Gwei = 1x10^-9 Ether. Nonce: The count of transactions sent out of the account. The number is initialized at 0 and is incremented by 1 for each transaction sent. Input Data: Information that is passed to a smart contract when a transaction is sent to its address. However, if the transaction is creating a contract, the contract\u2019s bytecode is placed in the input data field. I recommend checking out this article if you are not very familiar with how gas is used in Ethereum. Gas and Ethereum Transactions Reading data from the blockchain has no cost, however, when you want to change data recorded in the chain you are required to submit a transaction. In short, gas is a way of measuring the amount of computation and storage required to execute a change. Transactions in Bitcoin are rather straightforward, you have an amount of BTC and you create a transaction that sends it to another address. With the complexity of smart contracts, Ethereum transactions can have a large range of effects. In order to make sure that a user appropriately pays for the complexity of their transaction, gas is used to measure how much computational work and storage is needed in order to execute it. When submitting a transaction, a user will specify a gas limit, which is the highest amount of gas the transaction is allowed to expend. The transaction will fail if it exceeds the limit. The gas price is the amount of Ether the user is willing to pay per unit of gas (most commonly expressed in Gwei. 1 Gwei = 1x10^-9 Ether). For transactions where not all of the gas is used, the remaining Ether is refunded back to the account that created the transaction. \u201cOut of Gas\u201d Error Message There are a number of reasons why an Ethereum transaction might fail. The most common issue is that the transaction ran out of gas when the miner attempted to execute it. This will be apparent when you see a message that says \u201cWarning! Error encountered during contract execution [Out of gas]\u201d on Etherscan. This means that the transaction surpassed the gas limit that was specified when the transaction was created. Please use caution when setting the gas limit for a transaction that will be sent to a contract. If the limit is set too high the transaction might burn up all the Ether in your account. When a transaction runs out of gas, the proposed transaction fails, but the Ether that was dedicated to paying for gas is still given to the miner. Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) vs Contract Accounts There are two different types of accounts in Ethereum. The first are externally owned accounts (EOA), which are derived from a private key and able to generate transactions to poke the Ethereum network to do something. The second kind are contract accounts, which are able to store and execute code only when prompted by a transaction from an EOA. There are three different types of transactions between these accounts: an EOA sending Ether to another EOA, an EOA creating a contract, or an EOA sending a transaction to a contract. Transferring Ether Between Two Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) In the random transaction below, we can see that one externally owned account (EOA) is sending Ether to another EOA. We know this because the data input is empty, the To address isn\u2019t labeled as a contract address, and the value field is filled out. When moving Ether, we are telling the Ethereum network please decrease my balance x amount and increase the other account\u2019s balance by that amount. If the transaction is valid, then the global state of Ethereum updates the balances. In terms of gas considerations, a standard transfer of Ether from one EOA to another EOA costs 21,000 gas, which we can see is the amount used. Transferring ERC20 Tokens One of the biggest differences between transferring ERC20 tokens versus transferring Ether is that the transaction is addressed to the Token\u2019s contract address rather than the account we want to send the tokens to. In the random transaction below, the input data field includes the function we would like to call (in this case transfer). In addition, the inputs for the function, which includes the recipient's address along with the amount of tokens we want to send formatted in hexadecimal . Etherscan marks the To account as the DAI contract address and added a field called Tokens Transferred to display the input data in a more human readable format. Typically, the value field is left empty for token transfers because we only need to update to the contract\u2019s balances. Lastly, the gas cost for transferring ERC20 tokens can vary depending on how to contract was implemented. An Externally Owned Account (EOA) Creating a Contract Below is the transaction that created the Ethhub contract wallet. The most notable difference for contract creation transactions is that the input data contains the bytecode for the contract\u2019s logic. We can see that the contract\u2019s address is displayed in the To field with \u201cCreated\u201d next to it. Transferring Ether from an Externally Owned Account (EOA) to a Contract Account If you are sending Ether to a contract address, the gas cost can vary from the standard 21,000 gas. Viewing the transaction above we can see that someone made an Ether deposit to the Ethhub contract wallet, which required 22,511 gas. This is because the contract wallet also emits a Deposit event when receiving Ether, which bumps the gas cost over 21,000. That is why it is important to know what kind of account you are sending to before you assume that the gas cost will be 21,000 gas or else the transaction might run out of gas. In addition, there can be harmful side effects to sending a transaction to a contract that you aren\u2019t familiar with because contracts are able to forward messages to other contracts. Meaning that calling a function or simply depositing Ether to a malicious contract could execute code that might yield a negative result. Please always make sure that you trust the contract that you are about to submit a transaction to and set a reasonable gas limit. Resources Etherscan What is Ethereum Gas?

Rather using the traditional order book model, Uniswap pools tokens into smart contracts and users trade against these liquidity pools. Anyone can swap tokens, add tokens to a pool to earn fees, or list a token on Uniswap. This guide is meant to help beginners understand how Uniswap works under the hood. While the interface may appear simple, there is a lot going on behind the scenes. I recommend this resource if you are interested in understanding how to use the Uniswap specifically. ERC20 Token Primer ERC20 tokens are the most common type of token built on top of Ethereum. They are fungible in nature, meaning that there isn\u2019t a distinction between individual tokens. For example, if I have 100 metal marbles in my hand that are all the same size and color, it doesn\u2019t matter which one I give you. In the same way, if I have 100 of the same ERC20 token, it doesn\u2019t matter which one I give you. This contrasts with ERC721 tokens which are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) such as cryptokitties. ERC20s can be thought of as the most simple unit of account for a wide range of use cases including currency, rewards points, debt slips, interest accruing bonds, and much more. They are also highly divisible and can be sent in small increments. Since this type of token is so pervasive, it is important to develop a simple way of swapping between them. Please view the link here for more information on ERC20s. Overview of Uniswap\u2019s Contracts When viewing Uniswap\u2019s website, it is important to keep in mind that it is much more than just the interface. Uniswap starndaizes how ERC20s are exchanged with a set of smart contracts. Anyone can build an interface that connects to these contracts and instantly be able to start exchanging with everyone else that is using Uniswap. There are two different types of contracts that make up Uniswap. The first is known as an Exchange contract. Exchange contracts hold a pool of a specific token and Ether that users can swap against. The second kind of contract is the Factory contract which is in charge of creating new Exchange contracts and registering the ERC20 token address to its Exchange contract address. There are no listing fees to add a token on Uniswap, instead anyone can call a function on the Factory contract to register a new token. The graphic below is an example of when DAI was added to Uniswap. Someone first called the createExchange function in the Factory contract with DAI\u2019s contract address. Then the Factory contract checks it\u2019s registry to see if an Exchange contract has been created for that token address. If no Exchange address is listed, the factory contract deploys an Exchange contract and records the Exchange address in its registry. Liquidity Pools Uniswap is unique in that it doesn\u2019t use an order book to derive the price of an asset. In a centralized exchange, such as Coinbase Pro, the price of an asset listed on the exchange is determined by where the highest price someone is willing to pay and the lowest price someone is willing to sell meet. We can see in the image below, that the highest bid price for BTC on Coinbase Pro at that point was $9301.36 and the lowest asking price was $9301.37. Instead Uniswap uses the Exchange contracts to pool both Ether and a specific ERC20. When trading Ether for a token, Ether is sent to the contract\u2019s pool and the token is given back to the user. As a result, the user doesn\u2019t need to wait for a counterparty in order to exchange or worry about specifying a price. Since anyone can list a token and users don't need to worry about matching with someone else, it is very easy to avoid any bootstrapping issue when first launching a token. The amount that is returned from swapping is based on an automated market maker formula. The graph below helps illustrate how the formula works. Essentially, the amount that is returned to you is based on the ratio of Ether to token in in the pool. No matter the size of a swap, the user is guaranteed to have their trade execute because the more of an asset that you add to one side of the pool, the further along the curve it pushes you for the other asset. Meaning the larger the order relative to the pool, the worst rate you will receive as the ratio moves along the curve. You can learn more about the formula here . But if users are only just sending cryptocurrency, how does the ratio of Ether to token remain priced correctly relative to external markets? The answer is the pools maintain a ratio relative to the price of the rest of the market through people arbitraging the pool. Imagine that the DAI:ETH pool is expressed in terms of a scale and when the scale is balanced the pool is appropriately priced relative to the market price of a centralized exchange. Let\u2019s say that the current price for ETH in USD on a centralized exchange is $150 and the ratio in the Uniswap DAI:ETH pool returns 150 DAI for 1 ETH. As a result, our scale is balanced because the pool matches the current market price on the centralized exchange. Now let\u2019s assume that there is a movement in the market that pushes the price of ETH to $100 on the centralized exchange. Due to the price movement, we can now see that our scale is off balance relative to the market price because people can now swap 1 ETH for 150 DAI on Uniswap when the market price on a centralized exchange is $100 for 1 ETH. In response, someone can now put ETH into the pool, draw out DAI, then sell the DAI back for ETH on the centralized exchange for profit, and then repeat. They can do this until the pool has balanced out and reflects the current market price on a different exchange. As a result, third party arbitrages play a large role in maintaining the correct ratio of token to Ether in Uniswap pools. Swapping ERC20 \u21c4 ERC20 When interacting with a single Exchange contract, a user is able to swap between Ether and a specific ERC20 token. However, Uniswap does allow users to directly swap an ERC20 to another ERC20 in a single transaction. In the example below, the user has DAI and would like to receive MKR. As a result, the user calls the tokenToTokenSwap function which adds DAI to the DAI pool and kicks ETH to the MKR pool and returns MKR to the address that initially sent the transaction. Liquidity Providers When an Exchange contract is first created for a token, both the token and Ether pools are empty. The first person that deposits into the contract is the one that determines the ratio between the token and Ether. If they deposit a ratio that is different from what the current market rate is, then an arbitrage opportunity is available. When liquidity providers are adding to an established pool, they should add a proportional amount of token and Ether to the pool. If they don\u2019t, the liquidity they added is at risk of being arbitraged as well. In addition, larger liquidity pools are beneficial to users because they allow for larger swaps to happen without skewing the token to ETH ratio too far along the curve. Uniswap incentives users to add liquidity to pools by rewarding providers with fees that are collected by the protocol. A 0.3% fee is taken for swapping between Ether and a token and roughly a 0.6% is token for token to tokens swaps. Lastly, special ERC20 tokens known as liquidity tokens are minted to the provider\u2019s address in proportion to how much liquidity they contributed to the pool. The tokens are burned when the user wants to receive the liquidity they contributed plus the fees that we accumulated while their liquidity was locked. I recommend reading this article if you are curious about the advantages and risks of being a liquidity provider.

The second kind of contract is the Factory contract which is in charge of creating new Exchange contracts and registering the ERC20 token address to its Exchange contract address. There are no listing fees to add a token on Uniswap, instead anyone can call a function on the Factory contract to register a new token. The graphic below is an example of when DAI was added to Uniswap. Someone first called the createExchange function in the Factory contract with DAI\u2019s contract address. Then the Factory contract checks it\u2019s registry to see if an Exchange contract has been created for that token address. If no Exchange address is listed, the factory contract deploys an Exchange contract and records the Exchange address in its registry.","title":"Overview of Uniswap\u2019s Contracts"},{"location":"guides/graphical-guide-for-understanding-uniswap/#liquidity-pools","text":"Uniswap is unique in that it doesn\u2019t use an order book to derive the price of an asset. In a centralized exchange, such as Coinbase Pro, the price of an asset listed on the exchange is determined by where the highest price someone is willing to pay and the lowest price someone is willing to sell meet. We can see in the image below, that the highest bid price for BTC on Coinbase Pro at that point was $9301.36 and the lowest asking price was $9301.37. Instead Uniswap uses the Exchange contracts to pool both Ether and a specific ERC20. When trading Ether for a token, Ether is sent to the contract\u2019s pool and the token is given back to the user. As a result, the user doesn\u2019t need to wait for a counterparty in order to exchange or worry about specifying a price. Since anyone can list a token and users don't need to worry about matching with someone else, it is very easy to avoid any bootstrapping issue when first launching a token. The amount that is returned from swapping is based on an automated market maker formula. The graph below helps illustrate how the formula works. Essentially, the amount that is returned to you is based on the ratio of Ether to token in in the pool. No matter the size of a swap, the user is guaranteed to have their trade execute because the more of an asset that you add to one side of the pool, the further along the curve it pushes you for the other asset. Meaning the larger the order relative to the pool, the worst rate you will receive as the ratio moves along the curve. You can learn more about the formula here . But if users are only just sending cryptocurrency, how does the ratio of Ether to token remain priced correctly relative to external markets? The answer is the pools maintain a ratio relative to the price of the rest of the market through people arbitraging the pool. Imagine that the DAI:ETH pool is expressed in terms of a scale and when the scale is balanced the pool is appropriately priced relative to the market price of a centralized exchange. Let\u2019s say that the current price for ETH in USD on a centralized exchange is $150 and the ratio in the Uniswap DAI:ETH pool returns 150 DAI for 1 ETH. As a result, our scale is balanced because the pool matches the current market price on the centralized exchange. Now let\u2019s assume that there is a movement in the market that pushes the price of ETH to $100 on the centralized exchange. Due to the price movement, we can now see that our scale is off balance relative to the market price because people can now swap 1 ETH for 150 DAI on Uniswap when the market price on a centralized exchange is $100 for 1 ETH. In response, someone can now put ETH into the pool, draw out DAI, then sell the DAI back for ETH on the centralized exchange for profit, and then repeat. They can do this until the pool has balanced out and reflects the current market price on a different exchange. As a result, third party arbitrages play a large role in maintaining the correct ratio of token to Ether in Uniswap pools.","title":"Liquidity Pools"},{"location":"guides/graphical-guide-for-understanding-uniswap/#swapping-erc20-erc20","text":"When interacting with a single Exchange contract, a user is able to swap between Ether and a specific ERC20 token. However, Uniswap does allow users to directly swap an ERC20 to another ERC20 in a single transaction. In the example below, the user has DAI and would like to receive MKR. As a result, the user calls the tokenToTokenSwap function which adds DAI to the DAI pool and kicks ETH to the MKR pool and returns MKR to the address that initially sent the transaction.","title":"Swapping ERC20 \u21c4 ERC20"},{"location":"guides/graphical-guide-for-understanding-uniswap/#liquidity-providers","text":"When an Exchange contract is first created for a token, both the token and Ether pools are empty. The first person that deposits into the contract is the one that determines the ratio between the token and Ether. If they deposit a ratio that is different from what the current market rate is, then an arbitrage opportunity is available. When liquidity providers are adding to an established pool, they should add a proportional amount of token and Ether to the pool. If they don\u2019t, the liquidity they added is at risk of being arbitraged as well. In addition, larger liquidity pools are beneficial to users because they allow for larger swaps to happen without skewing the token to ETH ratio too far along the curve. Uniswap incentives users to add liquidity to pools by rewarding providers with fees that are collected by the protocol. A 0.3% fee is taken for swapping between Ether and a token and roughly a 0.6% is token for token to tokens swaps. Lastly, special ERC20 tokens known as liquidity tokens are minted to the provider\u2019s address in proportion to how much liquidity they contributed to the pool. The tokens are burned when the user wants to receive the liquidity they contributed plus the fees that we accumulated while their liquidity was locked. I recommend reading this article if you are curious about the advantages and risks of being a liquidity provider.","title":"Liquidity Providers"},{"location":"guides/graphical-guide-for-understanding-uniswap/#resources","text":"Uniswap Whitepaper Uniswap \u2014 A Unique Exchange Improving front running resistance of x*y=k market makers","title":"Resources"},{"location":"guides/guide-to-ens/","text":"The Ultimate Guide to ENS Names This article initially appeared as a Medium post authored by Eric Conner . The Ethereum Name Service is one of the most popular projects on Ethereum right now and for good reason. As the website states , \"ENS offers a secure decentralized way to address resources both on and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names.\" In short, you are able to give your Ethereum (or favorite chain ) address a name. This is much like how the traditional web works with DNS. All websites are hosted at an IP address but no one actually puts that in their browser, instead we use names such as amazon.com, not 205.251.242.103 (try it, it works!). The ENS has many great features but I'm going to focus this guide specifically on registering and managing .eth names and their subdomains. Registering .eth Domain Names The core functionality of the ENS is registering .eth domains. There are a few important rules to keep in mind when it comes to registering domains on the ENS: Minimum domain length is 3 characters. Annual renewal fees. 3 characters: $640/year, 4 characters: $160/year, 5+ characters $5/year. Emojis are valid. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Creating and Managing Domains Registering a domain is extremely easy using the ENS app . First search for the ENS name that you'd like. If it is not taken (if it is, head over to OpenSea and search for it), you will be presented with this screen. Once here you can click request to register which will trigger a transaction, wait 1 minute and then you can register the name. It's now yours. Now that you own a .eth domain, you want to enable all the cool features that it offers. This starts on the domain management screen. There is a lot going on so let's put all of the pieces together: Registrant: can set the controller address, and transfer the registration to someone else. This is the ultimate owner. Controller: essentially handles the \"day to day operations\" of the domain. Expiration Date: when your renewal fee is due and you can pay it here as well. Resolver: handles resolving (translating) the records put below such as what Ethereum address is tied to this domain. Should be set the public resolver which will be the default option when clicking the Set button. Records: this is where you can add the cool stuff to your domain. Put an address here so that when you put your domain name in a wallet, it points to this address. You can also put an IPFS content hash which when going to your domain in a web browser will pull up your website. Once you set an Ethereum address in the address field, it will resolve in wallets such as MetaMask. And if you point it to an IPFS hash, you can pull up the domain at ethhub.eth/ or ethhub.eth.link for browsers that don't resolve ENS names. Subdomains Subdomains offer great flexibility for building on top of .eth domains. If you are a company such as Maker and want to issue all your employees maker.eth subdomains, this is very easy to do. This section will cover both creating subdomains on a domain you own and unique ways of allowing others to buy subdomains on a domain you own. Creating and Managing Subdomains If you own a .eth domain and simply want to create subdomains for your own use, the easiest way to do this is through the ENS app by clicking on the Subdomains button. This is where you can add new subdomains. Once subdomains are setup, they act very similar to domains in that the owner can control them and setup records. That means something like eric.ethhub.eth can also resolve to an address and an IPFS website. Allowing Anyone to Claim Subdomains on your .eth Domain All of the above is being done by the registrant of the .eth domain. They are the one setting up the subdomains and have ultimate control over them, including being able to revoke them. This is fine for a company or someone that wants full control over the subdomains but what if you want anyone in the world to be able to claim a subdomain on your domain? You obviously don't want to have to coordinate with them and they won't want you to be able to revoke access. The good news is there is a solution that easily allows you to open up registration of subdomains on your domain. You can even set a price at which you'd like to sell them. Doing this starts with turning control of your domain over to the ENS Subdomain Registrar contract . This means that the contract is able to distribute out subdomains to people but you no longer can revoke access to those subdomains. The steps at the moment are fairly manual but also easy. Nick Johnson lays out the steps well in this ENSNow domains post so I'm going to just put them here: Warning: By doing this, you are permanently giving up use of your domain! You will be able to collect registration fees, change prices, and transfer control to another user\u200a-\u200abut you will never be able to use your domain for anything else! Load up the .eth registrar contract . If you are using Etherscan, you will need to click \"Connect with Metamask\" and authorize the subsequent dialog box from Metamask. Find the 'approve' function. In the address field, enter '0xc32659651d137a18b79925449722855aa327231d' In the tokenId field, enter the labelhash of your name. You can look this up by searching for your name on etherscan (look for 'Label hash [foo]:'). Submit the transaction. Load up the new subdomain registrar contract . Find the 'configureDomain' function. In the name field, enter the name you want to list, without '.eth' (Eg, 'gimmethe', not 'gimmethe.eth'). In the price field, enter the price to charge for a new domain, in wei. 1 ether is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei, so for instance to charge 0.01 ether per domain, you should enter 10000000000000000. A convertor can be found here . In the referralFeePPM field, enter the amount you want to give to any website that finds a new user for you. For instance, to keep the entire amount yourself, enter 0; to give it all to the site, enter 1000000. Submit the transaction. Your domain has now been handed over to the subdomain registrar contract. If you've set up a fee, anytime someone registers a subdomain, the funds will be directed to the original owner address. This has now opened up a lot of possibilities! Listing Your Subdomains on ENSNow The ENS team has setup a website which allows for claiming of subdomains. If you'd like your subdomains listed here the process is quite easy. Once again Nick has a blog post about the steps and I'm going to put them below: Go to this page and click 'fork' in the top right corner. Navigate to app - js - domains.json Click on the pencil icon in the top right corner of the file. Find the appropriate place to insert your entry (entries are listed alphabetically). Add a new line with your entry. If using the default registrar for steps 2 and 3, this should look like {\"name\": \"yourdomain\", \"version\": \"1.0\"}, . Commit your changes by clicking 'Commit changes' down the bottom of the page. Click on 'Pull requests', then 'New pull request'. Click on 'Create pull request'. Hosting Your Own Subdomain Sale Site ENSNow is great and easy, but the list of domains supported there is rather long and you cannot specifically brand your own domain. So, if you'd like to setup a site that only lists your domain and allows you to customize it, that is possible as well. A good example of this is a site I'm running called Ethmojis . The best place to start is on the Subdomain Registrar GitHub page . They have a \"getting started\" section which tells you how to run it but I'll try to summarize the steps up as best as I can below Install node.js and NPM Install Truffle on your computer using npm install -g truffle Download and install Ganache Clone the subdomain-registrar repo to your computer. In terminal, navigate to the folder you cloned it to and run npm install Find the /app/js/domains.json file and edit the whitelist to only include your domain.

Run: ganache-cli truffle deploy npm run dev If everything looks goo, run npm run build A build folder should be created and files output here. This is your final site that you can upload to a web server or IPFS. To host on IPFS , upload the entire build folder and get your content hash. You can then put this content hash in the \"records\" section of any ENS domain or subdomain!

Ether is necessary for Ethereum network security and operational efficiency for miners. Explanation The notion that transaction fees on Ethereum can be paid in-protocol by something other than ether such as an ERC20 token such as an ERC20 token is called 'economic abstraction'. We explain why the Ethereum protocol is unlikely to integrate economic abstraction below. Economic abstraction is often used to argue that the value of Ether will go to 0. The theory is that users could pay their transaction costs to miners in something other than Ether. Therefore, if that becomes rampant, Ether itself would have no value. This argument can be used on any Proof-of-Work blockchain, it's an especially popular criticism against Ethereum since it appears easy to create additional ERC20 tokens that can be exchanged for Ether. Quick recap on how transactions work on Ethereum. Each transaction uses a set amount of gas. Users pay miners to include their transaction using a gas price. Gas * Gas Price = transaction cost. The base protocol assumes gas price in ETH and every wallet calculates transaction cost in total ETH to pay. The argument against ETH value begins here. It says that users could pay their transaction cost in some currency or token instead of Ether, including digital USD. Miners could then directly sell tokens or currency into the currency of their choice. While rebuilding Ethereum to accept multiple currencies even USD even USD is theoretically possible, this argument ignores how digital native tokens like Ether or Bitcoin act as a layer of security for the system. Tokens like Ether reduce the profitability of network hacks by tying network security to the value of the network's medium of exchange. If network security gets hit, so does the value of the token transacted on the network. Imagine a rogue miner on Ethereum gathers enough computing power to successfully 51% attack the network and divert the network's currency to a personal account. If the currency's value isn't tied to network security say, USD say, USD , the hacker could easily sell these proceeds at full value in reasonably liquid markets. This cannot happen with Ether. Other miners would see this behavior immediately and make it known to relevant markets for Ether. As a result, not only would prices for Ether drop, Ether would also become highly illiquid, making it difficult for the hacker to make off with the pre-hack market value of the stolen Ether. This argument applies for any decentralized blockchain, including Bitcoin. Practically speaking, paying with multiple currencies also adds friction, cost, and a UX nightmare to the operations of a miner. It would have to go through the following process: Open communication with a miner Manually calc the cost of the tx in that tokens value Send miner payment wait for confirm Execute initial TX and get the nonce Tell the miner the nonce and wait for his next block On top of the added friction to users mentioned above, there is an added cost to users to pay for their transaction in something other than ETH. Sending ETH in a transaction costs 21000 gas while sending tokens costs 40000 gas or more. Calculating gas cost and understanding the gas market is no easy task. Wallets have spent years making this UX smooth. There is no incentive for a wallet to streamline the payment of gas in tokens as the complexities are deep. Now let's talk about miners. Miners are trying to make a profit and have to pay for hardware/electricity costs. They do not want to have a portfolio of 50 different cryptocurrencies with wild volatility and no liquidity. This creates an operational nightmare. As mentioned, this is possible on all PoW chains. Bitcoin even has a tool that enables users to pay for transaction speed in payments other than BTC http://confirmtx.com . However, because of the arguments above, it's not rampant in BTC or ETH because it violates core security assumptions and has extreme practical limitations for miners.

We explain why the Ethereum protocol is unlikely to integrate economic abstraction below. Economic abstraction is often used to argue that the value of Ether will go to 0. The theory is that users could pay their transaction costs to miners in something other than Ether. Therefore, if that becomes rampant, Ether itself would have no value. This argument can be used on any Proof-of-Work blockchain, it's an especially popular criticism against Ethereum since it appears easy to create additional ERC20 tokens that can be exchanged for Ether. Quick recap on how transactions work on Ethereum. Each transaction uses a set amount of gas. Users pay miners to include their transaction using a gas price. Gas * Gas Price = transaction cost. The base protocol assumes gas price in ETH and every wallet calculates transaction cost in total ETH to pay. The argument against ETH value begins here. It says that users could pay their transaction cost in some currency or token instead of Ether, including digital USD. Miners could then directly sell tokens or currency into the currency of their choice. While rebuilding Ethereum to accept multiple currencies even USD even USD is theoretically possible, this argument ignores how digital native tokens like Ether or Bitcoin act as a layer of security for the system. Tokens like Ether reduce the profitability of network hacks by tying network security to the value of the network's medium of exchange. If network security gets hit, so does the value of the token transacted on the network.

Answer No, the Ethereum fee market is independent of fiat prices. Explanation Basics of a transaction There are many concepts to understand when diving into the answer to this question. First, it's essential to understand how an Ethereum transaction works. As explained in the gas section , every transaction that occurs on the network requires a set amount of gas, which is a unit used to measure the computational power required to process the transaction. To process a transaction and include it in a block, miners expect to be compensated. This is accomplished by setting a gas price with every transaction, which is the cost of 1 unit of gas, denominated in Gwei 1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 Gwei 1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 Gwei . For example, when you simply send ETH from one account to another, this cost 21000 gas. If you were to set a gas price of 1 Gwei, this transaction would cost 0.000021 ETH. Fee market Currently, the Ethereum network is working at or near capacity. This means that a fee market is created because some users may be willing to pay more to get to the front of the line while others may not be in as big of a rush. Tools such as EthGasStation offer a great view into the current fee market and what it current costs to get a basic or fast transaction through. You'll notice that so far, we haven't talked about fiat or the cost of a transaction in fiat value. That's because at its core, the fee market is independent from the cost of Ether. Users have the ability to send a transaction from 0 gas price all the way to as high as they'd like and miners have the ability to accept the same range. Rising and falling Ether price While the gas market by design is purely Ether related, it'd be misleading to not acknowledge that a lot of users and miners think of their fees in fiat terms. So while the above example may have cost 0.000021 ETH, some users will instead think of that in terms of fiat cost $0.002793 for instance $0.002793 for instance . This means that the fee market, while independent of fiat prices at its core, will react to moves in Ether prices. If we use the example above and assume price spikes 5x, all of a sudden that transaction will cost $0.0139 in fiat terms. When price spikes assuming network demand stays the same assuming network demand stays the same , users will start to lower their gas price. When price falls assuming network demand stays the same assuming network demand stays the same , miners will start to raise their minimum accepted gas. We can see the fluctuation in average gas price in the past. Network demand As previously mentioned, network demand plays a much larger role on gas price than Ether price. If no one was using the network, gas prices paid would be near 0. If the network is full, gas prices will start to spike. This is an important consideration when trying to draw conclusions between Ether price and gas prices paid.","title":"Is Ethereum more expensive to use as price rises?"},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises","text":"","title":"Is Ethereum more expensive to use as price rises?"},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#answer","text":"No, the Ethereum fee market is independent of fiat prices.","title":"Answer  "},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#explanation","text":"","title":"Explanation  "},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#basics-of-a-transaction","text":"There are many concepts to understand when diving into the answer to this question.

Summary Ethereum's \"Difficulty Bomb\" refers to a mechanism that, at a predefined block number, increases the difficulty level of puzzles in the Proof of Work mining algorithm resulting in longer than normal block times (and thus less ETH rewards for miners). This mechanism increases the difficulty exponentially over time and eventually leads to what is referred to as the \"Ice Age\" - that is, the chain becomes so difficult to mine that it grinds to a halt and stops producing blocks (freezes). Why the Difficulty Bomb Exists The Difficulty Bomb was originally put in place for a variety of reasons: To act as a deterrant for miners who wish to continue mining the Ethereum 1.0 (Proof of Work) chain once the network moved fully to the Ethereum 2.0 (Proof of Stake) chain To ensure that the core developers of Ethereum 1.0 are \"forced\" to upgrade the network via a hard fork (if only to delay the effects of the bomb) so that the network does not stagnate innovation-wise Technical Details of the Difficulty Bomb Work in progress. Effects of the Difficulty Bomb The effect of the Difficulty Bomb is easily seen in the 'Ethereum Block Time History' chart from Etherscan (you'll notice that it is a step-function that increases block times the longer that it exists on the chain). Is the Difficulty Bomb Still Necessary? There is an open debate as to whether the Difficulty Bomb is still required because Ethereum 2.0 is now being deployed as a seperate blockchain (instead of a direct upgrade to the Ethereum 1.0 chain) and the bomb has been delayed without any fanfare in both the Byzantine and Constantinople network upgrades.
