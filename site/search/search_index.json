Here, you'll be able to work your way through the embankment of knowledge and insight provided by the Shaykh; from the many books he has written, to the articles and guides he has created, talks he has given, and other appearances he has made in more recent years. A little learning is a dangerous thing; Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring: There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, And drinking largely sobers us again. The goal of this archive is to provide a single source of information about an optimum way of being. We use the accessible language and symbolism developed by the Shaykh in order to present the timeless prophetic teachings and relate them to the modern world. \"For once we have observed the divine transcendent beauty and majesty in creation, we wish to remain in that state. The truth is that we are already in that unified state, but it is up to us to remain conscious of it. This is the choice given to us.\" There is nothing new in our search for freedom. There is nothing new in our ability to reach that state of limitless freedom, and there is nothing new in the fact that the only way to that freedom is by our submission to truth and thereby our awakening to it. The only new dimension is time itself, for the moment never repeats. It is forever fresh and new. As Abi ibn Ali Talib said, 'You are the evident book by whose signs that which was hidden becomes apparent'. The greatest puzzle is that the eternal secret is ever effulgent. But are our eyes strong enough to look at the sun?\" The only contact we have with Allah is now. Yesterday is of no use and we don\u2019t know if we will be here tomorrow or not.

The Academy of Self Knowledge delivers a range of dynamic courses, workshops and seminars in the journey of self-discovery. Universal, soul- stirring questions are addressed, such as: What is happiness? Does my life have a purpose? How can I find harmony in my relationships? What does it mean to be in connection with my soul? Is it possible to live joyfully in today\u2019s world? Founded in 2003 by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, ASK offers key principles which give us an insight into who we truly are, what motivates us and what hinders us from living our best life. Once we have been given these maps of the self, the challenge then lies in how to lead our lives in an optimal way that supports our growing consciousness. We are often aware of the desire to maintain our spiritual values, but find it difficult to navigate our way in a world that feels challenging. Unlike most courses, the ASK program not only gives you the knowledge base but also realistic applications by which you will experience real transformation in your life, building on the premise that knowledge alone is not power, but that applied knowledge has the power to transform. What ASK offers We offer \"maps of truth that will illumine the journey in this life and the hereafter\". The Academy has developed bespoke packages of learning that meet the requirements of specific groups and organizational needs. Currently we regularly run two types of intensive courses, either over a few months or over full weekend workshops. Both of these are highly participative, interactive and self-reflective to deepen one\u2019s understanding of our own real life experiences.

Read More","title":"Articles"},{"location":"articles/decree-destiny-enlightenment/","text":"Decree, Destiny and Enlightenment By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, from the book \"Decree Destiny \u2013 Free Will and Determinism\" . Decrees are the rules which define life\u2019s experiences on earth. Most of these rules are describable or measurable, especially those dealing with the visible realities. The rules that govern all aspects of physical (visible and experiential) existence combine with those that control the unseen forces to form a network that will result in, for example, the laws of physics. We can describe the phenomenon of light, for instance, as both a wave and a particle called a photon. The rules somehow emerge from an unknown domain into describable, measurable, physical laws. So the decrees can be seen as a series of multitudinous models by means of which the creation, seen and unseen, is held together. Destiny is the final occurrence that is experienced by the individual through the passage of time, when these laws are enacted. It is when a describable event has already passed through time. The concept of destiny is also parallel in Arabic to another term \u2019ajal , which signifies \u2018appointed time, date, deadline, instant of death, respite, delay\u2019. If we say a business partnership has an \u2018ajal of five years, it means that at the end of this period it will have reached its full destiny, which is dissolution. The final destiny of every man is his awakening to his permanent, non-time reality, from which he has emerged. We are given the experience of this life, with all its decrees, for us to know them, accept them and become one with them so that we can see our destiny within them, and our destiny beyond them, when time stops at the point of death. Through the discipline of meditative practices, time can be experienced as coming to a stop. Whilst we fear death we love and are dependent on deep sleep, which is the nearest experience to death. If we are able to experience the mini-death of inner contemplation, we stand a good chance of realizing that our true reality, the Source of the cause behind existence, is eternal and ever present. It is only the body that dies, while the soul or spirit continues into perpetuity. As we are all programmed to dislike fear, the universal fear of death betrays the true meaning of death. It is only an experiential barrier that demarcates a natural discrimination by returning the body to where it belongs, and by returning the soul to whence it originally emanated from in the zone of eternal consciousness. So the fact that we do not like death reveals a certain measure of its falsehood as a termination of life. It is in fact a process of segregation. The confusion is due to identifying with the body and mind rather than the soul within. It is only the body that dies; for it has been the vehicle for the development of the self, whose proper schooling lies in the melting pot of the world of duality, whilst yearning for the knowledge of the One from whom it emanated in the first place. The human destiny is potentially the highest of known creations \u2013 as was our beginning. We start life with a basic level of existence and are driven to reach the highest levels of consciousness and experiences. Enlightenment is to know the perfection and reliability of God\u2019s plan; with reflection and wisdom we realize that human will is a very small factor in contentment and sustained happiness. Spiritual wisdom leads to witnessing the utter perfection of the instant and abandonment to the moment. Then we come to understand the truth that abundance is available at all times to everyone. This is the final awakening to the state of Oneness. We are brought into time in order that we may face the incredible, unfathomable, never-ending non-time. So we are already predestined to face eternity. This is the intended perfect destiny and anything else is incomplete.","title":"Decree, Destiny and Enlightenment"},{"location":"articles/decree-destiny-enlightenment/#decree-destiny-and-enlightenment","text":"By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, from the book \"Decree Destiny \u2013 Free Will and Determinism\" .

The human destiny is potentially the highest of known creations \u2013 as was our beginning. We start life with a basic level of existence and are driven to reach the highest levels of consciousness and experiences. Enlightenment is to know the perfection and reliability of God\u2019s plan; with reflection and wisdom we realize that human will is a very small factor in contentment and sustained happiness. Spiritual wisdom leads to witnessing the utter perfection of the instant and abandonment to the moment. Then we come to understand the truth that abundance is available at all times to everyone. This is the final awakening to the state of Oneness. We are brought into time in order that we may face the incredible, unfathomable, never-ending non-time. So we are already predestined to face eternity. This is the intended perfect destiny and anything else is incomplete.","title":"Decree, Destiny and Enlightenment"},{"location":"articles/dhikr-fikr-himmah/","text":"Dhikr, Fikr, and Himmah By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, from the book \u201cThe Sufi Way to Self-Unfoldment\u201d . The Path lies in dhikr , fikr and himmah . Dhikr is the remembrance of God, from whom I am separated by my self. It is this illusion that is caused by me that is the cause of this barrier, separation. So it is a process of elimination. If I overcome the self, if I remove all of these images, all of these goggles that I have erroneously put on, then I am bound to be less separated from that which is the source of all beingness. So remembrance is necessary for us to begin to dissolve the self. If I remember God at the moment of agitation and disappointment, if I remember the Creator of the entire cosmos, from Whom this life is allotted for a few years, then my own little misery, my own problem, put in the large perspective, is bound to gain a measure of relief. It is bound to be a remedy for whatever situation I am in. Remembrance begins as an outside activity. Then it belongs to the heart. How can I remember God when I am full of me? When the bucket is full of me, there is no room for anything else. It is a displacement process. A bucket of pure water with mud particles in suspension can be purified again if we place it under a tap which drips into it fresh clear water. In time, this bucket of mud begins to get cleaner and cleaner and begins to reflect more of its real nature of pure water. Our nature is that of purity. That is why we like purity \u2013 we are basically pure at source. So there is no room for personal guilt. Our heritage is purity and the simplicity of beingness. But, because of the activities which we undertake in the world, we begin to solidify the roles and images into a personality with apparently conflicting and often irreconcilable aspects. It is by remembrance of God that I can begin to melt down the layers that I have created which are the source of my agitation, problems, and expectations. It is the most vital activity. A muslim prays five times a day, five formal and definable times for dhikr and salat (prayer). Five times to remember and submit to Allah, outwardly and inwardly. Fikr is that light which is shed on a scene in order to discriminate: what is good and what is bad, what is lasting and what is not, right and wrong, black and white. If we are in a state of real remembrance, then discrimination will operate spontaneously. Suppose we stop the moving film of our actions and freeze a frame. Dhikr freezes the \u2018frame\u2019 of action and fikr shines the torch of discrimination on it. Subsequent correct action will result from this. The film shows that I disliked your presence here to such an extent that I proceeded to punch you, and all of a sudden I see myself in this childish act, in the frozen shot of this film. If I catch myself in that instant, I am bound to discriminate and immediately correct the course. But we are often slow, and leave it too late. After I have done it I plead for forgiveness and say, \u2018It wasn\u2019t me!\u2019 What this means is that, after the event, I have had a replay of the act, because it was fresh in my memory, and in the light of discrimination. Neither remembrance nor discrimination will occur unless there is himmah \u2013 energy, yearning to be true, full, alive. The more we have this energy, the more it becomes available. It is like tapping a source: the more you clean the head of the spring, the more clear water will flow. But because we are accustomed to living in a manner that is totally incorrect and harmful, and which we try to persevere, we are scared of change and shut ourselves up in our private rooms. It is because we want to persevere habits. We are afraid of opening our hands to drop the thorns which we have clasped and made ours. But, when the pain is deep and real, then great yearning will enable us to act, drop the thorns and find the freedom that was there to begin with anyway. You may ask, \u2018if it is so easy, then what are all these methods for?\u2019 In a way, it is like picking up new thorns at will in order to get rid of the thorn that has been aching in you all these years \u2013 the old self. So there must be a beginning. The extent of new speed of the raft, floating on the stream of the past, depends entirely on the extent of the new energy in you. The greater the yearning and burning, the greater the energy. The greater is your suffering, the more you are qualified to free yourself from it. When fear is mild, one can brush it aside. When it is vast, new basic treatment is necessary and final cure is more probable. So the three basic requirements of the Path are entirely interrelated. Each of them reinforces the others, both in quantity and quality. If I have greater awareness, then more discrimination will constantly illuminate my actions. Therefore, more of my new actions will be such that they are not likely to enhance the self in me. Slowly, one observes the vanishing \u2018I\u2019-ness: arrogance, vanity, personality. So the outcome of the path towards self-knowledge is getting rid of the impermanent. Get rid of the \u2018I\u2019 and you will see the real self. It is a process of elimination. The embryonic seed of real knowledge is in everyone. But, in most cases, it has been tarnished or covered by the layers of the personality.","title":"Dhikr, Fikr, Himmah"},{"location":"articles/dhikr-fikr-himmah/#dhikr-fikr-and-himmah","text":"By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, from the book \u201cThe Sufi Way to Self-Unfoldment\u201d .

May every instant of our lives be full of joyful optimism so that we progress from one level of understanding and inner light to a higher one, until such time there is nothing left for us to do in this world other than to remain in the ecstasy of truly saying, knowing, singing \"la ilaha illallah\" ! I would like to share with you the origin of this Eid celebration. We love to celebrate, to be in a state of positive expectation, to be generous, intelligent and courageous. So we celebrate the Eid in order for us to return to the original condition of our father Adam in the Garden. This state of consciousness is within our soul and needs to be recalled by transcending our earth bound identity. Life on this Earth is a prelude to a return to the Garden from where Adam, Hawa and all of us \u2013 as children of Adam \u2013 came from. On earth we are constantly challenged with dualities and choices. We seek the best continuously. This life of ours on earth is only a practice to return back to the Garden. This is why we love beautiful, tranquil, earthly gardens with water and flowers. Unlike these gardens, the original Garden is forever. It does not change. The Qur\u2019an mentions that for all those who are in cautious awareness and remembrance, paradise is close by. We move after this month of restriction back to normality. We only need to restrict a little of the outer in order to increase on the inner. The wonderful experiences during the month of fasting enable us to access a higher zone of consciousness and boundlessness. The word Eid appears only once in the Qur\u2019an, in Surah Ma\u00b4idah . It is the story of the sincere followers of the Prophet Isa. They ask him: \"Can\u2019t you bring upon us from the unseen a banquet or a meal, or some nourishment? We want to taste of it so that our hearts become completely certain that all of it is from Allah.\" So Isa asks his Lord to bring down a heavenly banquet \u2013 an Eid , not only for those who came first but also for those of later time. We always quest the proof of the connection between the seen and the unseen, as our soul is heavenly but living on earth. This is the meaning of Eid . The Arabic root is aada , \u2018to have returned\u2019. Return to what? All of us, who have fasted, tend to return once more towards over indulgence. This is not an interesting return. What is worthwhile to return to is the original condition of Adam in the Garden. We need to move towards that Eid . A day in which you are constantly aware of Allah\u2019s presence with you is an Eid . So every instant can be an Eid , meaning a return back to the original state that we aspire for. We are here to interact in this world without being overwhelmed by it. This knowledge is liberating. Our worldly existence is not a prison. It can be a path towards the ultimate liberated perfection. Space and time will no longer hold us down as happens in our normal consciousness. We want to do things fast and go beyond the speed of light. We want to do everything instantly, so that we are close to that state of constant, timeless perfection. This is our original nature. This is where we came from, and this is where we are all struggling to return to. Our path is based on grooming the self. Once you have realised that the lower self is of no consequence it can lead you to your higher self. The lower self is only an ego, ever changing, ever treacherous, and you can only recognise its shadows and darkness because of the divine light in you. You, then, recognize that you are often frightened, often greedy, that you are ignorant about what comes after death and are scared of it. Once you taste this knowledge you realise you are a soul. Every one of us desires the same thing. Beyond what we see as troubles and difficulties there is a most just Creator, whose order is within us. No matter the individual level of knowledge, education, spiritual understanding and awakening, we all have the same potential. All of us have a soul, which is a spark from the original sacred light of Allah. We all have a divine treasure in our heart.Once we realise that our source of inspiration and connection to Allah \u2013 our soul \u2013 lies within us, we can rise to the true original Adamic worshipfulness. Allah will guide everybody how best to worship. All we need to do is to stop our lower self. This is all what we can do. We have no control over the soul. So this is why it all begins with \"la ilaha illallah\" . Eid is about arrival. It is about returning to where we have emanated from, returning to the state that we yearn for.

No matter what we look at in existence, we find that it can always be traced back to its one original source, Allah. Recognising the One Existent Creator while we live in this world of multiple forms is essential for our well-being. Without such a unitive recognition and awareness, we tend to fluctuate between being disturbed and tranquil. Like the pilgrimage to Makka, journey of transformation requires letting go all of one\u2019s assumptions. All links with the past must be cut, irrespective of culture and identity. We cannot deny that the past has happened; its benefits could continue to unfold in innumerable ways. However, if we succeed in letting go, of not making comparisons or clinging to what we imagine will give us happiness, our minds will be more alert to the moment. Our hearts will also be empty of negative feelings such as fear, greed and jealousy. Then we will be transformed. People often say that they find it hard to give up their attachments. Those who hang on to their material possessions, habits, and ideas must stop to think: what is it that they feel they have to give up? What promises were they given in the womb? Nothing belongs to us. We merely borrow certain minerals and other matter that constitute the body from the earth, in order for us to journey from the unseen, interact with creation, and to return to the unseen with the light of knowledge that Allah has provided for us. Created to reside for a short while in the darkness in the womb, we emerge, encompassed by the Light that enables us to see sunlight, as well as the darkness of numerous shadows. This is the path of discovery. Without embarking on this journey we have no hope of entering the city of knowledge that lies unconquered within us from before time. Transformation is possible if the prescription is correct and applied with care. Here we enter an altogether new state which, if maintained, leads to a station of being that encompasses and transcends our humanity. Allah says in the Qur\u2019an that He will not change people unless they change themselves. This applies to each individual and to society. Indeed, if we start by changing the individual, we will end up with a changed society. Only when we arrive at the true knowledge of our origin can we hope to serve society. Attempting to serve others before having arrived at such knowledge will only project our inner confusion onto others. If, however, we return to our original station of fusion, of being completely integrated in our knowledge of the outer and the inner, the seen and the unseen, then we may be of some use to the rest of mankind. Once we arrive at the real knowledge that is already contained within us, we find that we are constantly circling the inner Ka\u2019ba that symbolises the believer\u2019s heart, and which is seen to be the seat of all truth. This perpetual, spontaneous awareness puts us in a constant state of jih\u0101d (striving) and purifies our intentions. We learn to face ourselves with honesty and question whether we are serving others with expectation of reward or praise. Do we recognise that what we are giving to others, in terms of material wealth or a service, is from the very Source of giving, mercy and generosity? Or is it instead an act that will merely gratify our egos, based on enhancing our reputations or our society, or to impose the glitter of our knowledge on others? The ability to do this is a great blessing. It is a remarkable gift to be able to give to others what does not, in any case, belong to us. We only have it on loan from our Creator. If we make ourselves completely neutral by giving up the past and our attachments while keeping ourselves open to inspiration, coupled with willingness to undertake appropriate work, then we are true wayfarers on the path of unity. This is positive action. It is not the occurrence of some fantastic or miraculous event; the miracle is life itself.

It is important to see the teachings of the Prophets and Spiritual Masters in their full context. Ibn al-\u2018Arabi writes about the virtues of generosity, asceticism, night vigils but equally emphasizes the importance of giving up identification and the image of being generous. Role-playing, irrespective of how good the role may be, is a spiritual hindrance. One other important advice to sincere seekers is not to dwell deeply on descriptions of the path to enlightenment in old Sufi literature, early on along their spiritual journey. Once you have a better understanding of these maps of reality you can learn the various aspects of your experiences. Sufi treaties can be helpful in confirming to you that others have traversed the same terrain and a few describe well the new state of awakening. Embrace the path with trust until you experience intimate interaction with Reality. The mind registers whether something is familiar or not. When you are in a new land you must personally imbibe all its atmosphere and energy, otherwise you may be regurgitating someone else\u2019s views or feelings. No two people are the same as humans. Everyone is the same in spirit. I benefited from Ibn al-\u2018Arabi when I had experienced the states and stations he described. \"The Meaning of Man\" by Sidi Ali al-Jamal is a good example of a book that can confuse novices because it addresses people at different levels of spiritual evolvement. I have worked with Shaykh Hosam Raouf on an abridged version to render it more accessible. You talk to a youngster in a different way to a mature seeker. Specialist treaties, like this, need to be used by qualified teachers, rather than for general consumption. This is the original reason why the Brahmans and Rabbis claimed an exclusive right for the dissemination of their scriptures to avoid the danger of confusion and misinterpretation purposefully or due to lack of truly living them.

It is important to see the teachings of the Prophets and Spiritual Masters in their full context. Ibn al-\u2018Arabi writes about the virtues of generosity, asceticism, night vigils but equally emphasizes the importance of giving up identification and the image of being generous. Role-playing, irrespective of how good the role may be, is a spiritual hindrance. One other important advice to sincere seekers is not to dwell deeply on descriptions of the path to enlightenment in old Sufi literature, early on along their spiritual journey. Once you have a better understanding of these maps of reality you can learn the various aspects of your experiences. Sufi treaties can be helpful in confirming to you that others have traversed the same terrain and a few describe well the new state of awakening. Embrace the path with trust until you experience intimate interaction with Reality. The mind registers whether something is familiar or not. When you are in a new land you must personally imbibe all its atmosphere and energy, otherwise you may be regurgitating someone else\u2019s views or feelings. No two people are the same as humans. Everyone is the same in spirit. I benefited from Ibn al-\u2018Arabi when I had experienced the states and stations he described. \"The Meaning of Man\" by Sidi Ali al-Jamal is a good example of a book that can confuse novices because it addresses people at different levels of spiritual evolvement. I have worked with Shaykh Hosam Raouf on an abridged version to render it more accessible. You talk to a youngster in a different way to a mature seeker. Specialist treaties, like this, need to be used by qualified teachers, rather than for general consumption. This is the original reason why the Brahmans and Rabbis claimed an exclusive right for the dissemination of their scriptures to avoid the danger of confusion and misinterpretation purposefully or due to lack of truly living them.

The spider\u2019s web is exposed to the elements of nature: heat, cold, wind and rain.

Man takes refuge in Allah when he pursues the knowledge of Reality by realizing that everything other than Allah is relative and unsatisfactory, like the house of the spider.

We always hope to discover answers to our day-to-day questions as well as the big questions in life. How did life begin? How and when will life end? Who am I really? Who are you? What is the purpose of life? Philosophical people often answer that it is to know Truth or God. What is that? We are often told that we have duties and responsibilities in this life. What are these and what is their purpose? What is truth and where is it? What is real and constant? Will we ever know the truth in this life? Life, Death and Change Several religions say that everyone will know the truth after death. In that case, where is God\u2019s love and generosity in this world? At all times we seek to avoid pain, fear and sorrow, yet no one is ever spared these experiences in varying intensity and duration. We all want to live a fulfilled and happy life, yet we are unlikely to meet anyone who has successfully attained that state durably. Why do we experience ever-changing feelings and moods? Much of life\u2019s experiences can be pleasant and desirable yet there are numerous events that cause grief, pain and misery. How can we experience and enjoy the highest quality of life? How can we maintain a healthy balance in body, mind and heart? What is the purpose of religion and spiritual aspiration? Why is it that nothing ever gives us sustained contentment? What is it that we are really striving to achieve? What sort of life do we experience, if any, after death? Life on earth is due to the interplay between energy and matter within space and time. Basic life began a few hundred million years ago, giving rise to human consciousness as we experience it now. There are two sides to human nature. One has evolved over millions of years and contains traces of all that exists on earth. The other side of our composition is a celestial bundle of lights and energies often named as spirit or soul. This celestial life source is our real nature which we long for \u2013 the God within. The development of our personality and conditioned consciousness takes place in this dynamic of an animal self confined within space and time, and energised by the spirit. Religious practices are there to refine the animal self and enable it to be guided by the light, soul or spirit. Most world religions advocate respect for life and all living things, and for humans to exercise modesty, generosity and accountability in upholding higher values, ethics, virtuous conduct, selfless service to other beings and constant gratitude to God irrespective of outer circumstances. All of this is meaningful and possible to follow if you accept the premise that our journey on earth is to rise in consciousness from the lowest animal selfish tendencies to pure consciousness, cosmic governance, or divine prevalence. Islam highlights what so many earlier prophets and sages before Muhammad had emphasised and tried to inculcate in their people and cultures. Unity The crucial issue is the unitive nature of truth and reality or God as the source of life and all creation, and this cosmic source is also the final destiny. Everything has emanated from that essence and returns to it. The teachings of the Qur\u2019an and the way of Muhammad also highlight the purpose of human existence and its transient nature from the lower self to the divine soul itself, from birth to death, all of which is in preparation for the full unveiling of Truth after death \u2013 eternal cosmic connectedness. Death is a most natural transfer from dualities and confinement within space and time to eternal oneness. The Qur\u2019an reveals that real life is ever continuous and not subject to beginnings or ends, such as birth and death. We experience, in fact, two modes of birth and death. One birth is physical, biological and emotional, and the other one is awakening to the ultimate truth, which is the nature of our own soul. This spiritual birth is the essential drive within all human desires and hopes, the source of which can be accessed and touched upon through transcendence of all sensory experiences and conditioned consciousness. A preparation for this is meditation, contemplation, silence and solitude. The Qur\u2019an and prophetic teachings emphasise the duty and purpose of human beings, which is to transcend the lower self to the divine soul in preparation for ongoingness in the hereafter. Real education and grooming evolves us to act as accountable and responsible earthly stewards \u2013 the master is the divine soul. All our life experiences are practices towards higher infinite consciousness, and the many grades, scales, zones and domains that it encompasses. All of this will be experienced fully after a period of the rattling and shaking of purification after death, described by most world religions. The Abrahamic religions are clear about heaven, hell and purgatory. Others have similar teachings, including that of reincarnation \u2013 if you haven\u2019t succeeded in transcending to higher consciousness then you will return. All world religions have some notion that if you have not progressed sufficiently towards higher consciousness before death then there is going to be a \u2019decompression\u2019 so that whatever you have carried within yourself as traces and fantasies is eradicated. But if you have practiced eradication, like the Buddhist practice of death with its eight different stages, then it is a natural progression towards liberation from the illusion of separation. Practicing Surrender Islam, like some other world religions, prescribes practices that elevate consciousness through reflecting upon day-to-day habits, which are otherwise performed without full attention or reflection. The human purpose on earth is to ascend in consciousness from a very basic survival level to illumined awakening and arrival. When self-awareness becomes a natural constant habit, then every moment becomes enriched with vibrancy and delight. Religious practices and rituals are the beginnings of alignment between self and soul and transcending the material world to higher consciousness. Formally, you pray five times a day (which also has an important social aspect to it) until, as the Qur\u2019an describes, you are perpetually in that plugged-in state. The same applies to all other rituals. In a sense, you are at all times on pilgrimage. While with fasting, you are at all times aware of what you are putting in your mouth or what you are putting in your head. So let this month be different from other months, even if you cannot fast. Whatever you ingest, be aware of it, be more conscious of it. Marvel at how it is possible for you to lift your hand or even a finger. Enter the magic of this month so that all year round you will be aware of where you are sitting, why you are drinking, where you put your cup. Your whole life then becomes an act of worship. Life has to flow. It has to be fun and we all seek and hope for that. Initially with a child there is a little bribery and corruption \u2013 \u2018Do it for mummy\u2019s sake\u2019. But later on, by being in the dot of the now, by being present, you are already participating in the treasures of eternal life. If you are truly practicing silence and awareness of the moment and its immensity, then you know time and non-time; the eternal and the short, all lie in that moment. So you will know that the present moment, of which you are experiencing a little of its coming and its going, is perfect. You will know that the present moment contains within it eternity. You will know it is perfect. Bring that to the social level and you will never ever lament the difficulties of today \u2013 the bad culture, people don\u2019t listen, children are rebellious, etc. You must not regurgitate what you have been reiterating from the past. Read it. It will tell you. There is utter perfection in the moment; therefore, if you take today\u2019s time, you will recognise it is much better than ten years ago and much much better than a hundred years ago. This is a touchstone of contentment. The present moment contains all that happened in the past and gives a clear indication of what will happen in the future. By denying the perfection of the moment we will lack contentment and happiness will remain elusive. Divisions and differences between human beings are natural. So is our love for harmony and unity. Every one of us experiences constant change within space and time whilst we seek perspective and refer to higher consciousness with its boundless constancy. No two moments are the same for any living entity. Within each moment is the duality of what is attractive and what is not. Each and every living entity can act like a war machine with animosity and discord whilst wishing for peace and goodness, albeit in the distant future. How can we overcome enmity and discord, and accept differences in opinion, culture, or way of life, as natural occurrences just like the countless plants, flowers, flavors and colors? All humans are similar in many ways but also differ in other ways. No matter what we do, no matter what we say, every person and every people have a flavour. Reference to higher consciousness will put things in perspective and will show you the appropriate path. Lasting Contentment Peace and prosperity can only become durable when inner peace and contentment is attained when the self becomes subservient to the soul, thereby accessing timeless joy. Peace and prosperity become socially durable and universal when personal inner peace and contentment is attained by a number of people who have an influence over the community and society, and their guidance becomes a touchstone for normal conduct and behaviour. In the past, religious people, saints, sages and others were regarded as the ultimate reference points and arbiters when there were serious differences and disputes between people and communities. In our day-to-day life today we need the wisdom of perspective, durable goodness and true accountability regarding intentions and actions. The supreme treasure of all is the divine spirit within the heart, which is the ultimate guiding reference for fulfilled living. When a mature person is in constant attention, reflection and reference to the higher level of consciousness, then fulfillment is attained in the world of duality, change and uncertainty. This awakened being is constantly energised by permanent life and therefore regards death as a natural ascent to the liberated zone of eternal presence. Fears and sorrows become insignificant and the nature of death reveals itself to be a gift of liberation from the limitations of the earthly journey. Our limited world of dualities drives us to understand the cause and effect, origin and destiny, of all that exists in preparation for the state beyond death, beyond self-identity and the illusion of independence or separation from sacred oneness. Most of what we experience in nature is complementary and symbiotic and even where there appears to be divergence, nature acts to regulate the natural flow of diversities in life. With the human urge to investigate, study and discover the nature of material objects as well as feelings and emotions, we reach the conclusion that the entire of existence is differentiated sameness. No two moments are the same but the nature of time and space remains the same. If you simply live totally in the now then you are directly energised by higher eternal consciousness. Now is forever and so is the inner soul or spirit. So hasten with patience. Wait, especially if you are in a rush. Celebrate! It is human nature to be hopeful, cheerful and to celebrate goodness. Most people use any excuse to celebrate and leave behind sorrow, fear, or insecurity. We all love to celebrate \u2013 it is deep in the human psyche. Individually we celebrate within ourselves because that is our kingdom, and collectively with the wider kingdom. Celebration is victory, and victory is beyond success and failure. But we end up having pseudo-celebrations, like birthdays or the \u2018independence\u2019 of a country. We need to ask ourselves what is it that is worthy of celebration at all times and all occasions without any bitterness or regrets later on? Celebration is only going to be meaningful through Islam, Iman and Ihsan. Each is a zone of consciousness. Islam is that there is nothing in my hand; I didn\u2019t know who I was, I didn\u2019t know what was birth, I don\u2019t know what death is, so I have to surrender into the vast unknown. Iman is that I trust that it has been going on for millions of years so there must be some stability, some referencing, some governorship. That is Iman; I have faith, I have trust, I can rely upon the perfection that emerges from the unseen, whether experienced or not. Ihsan is that there is no \u2018me\u2019 anymore \u2013 there is only perfection; so if I am truly basking in that perfection I cannot but transmit that with which I have been saturated. Life is glorious and we celebrate it perpetually.","title":"Pointers to Haqq"},{"location":"articles/pointers-to-haqq/#pointers-to-haqq-truth","text":"Written by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri June 2018 Human needs, desires and questions never end.

How can we maintain a healthy balance in body, mind and heart? What is the purpose of religion and spiritual aspiration? Why is it that nothing ever gives us sustained contentment? What is it that we are really striving to achieve? What sort of life do we experience, if any, after death? Life on earth is due to the interplay between energy and matter within space and time. Basic life began a few hundred million years ago, giving rise to human consciousness as we experience it now. There are two sides to human nature. One has evolved over millions of years and contains traces of all that exists on earth. The other side of our composition is a celestial bundle of lights and energies often named as spirit or soul. This celestial life source is our real nature which we long for \u2013 the God within. The development of our personality and conditioned consciousness takes place in this dynamic of an animal self confined within space and time, and energised by the spirit. Religious practices are there to refine the animal self and enable it to be guided by the light, soul or spirit. Most world religions advocate respect for life and all living things, and for humans to exercise modesty, generosity and accountability in upholding higher values, ethics, virtuous conduct, selfless service to other beings and constant gratitude to God irrespective of outer circumstances. All of this is meaningful and possible to follow if you accept the premise that our journey on earth is to rise in consciousness from the lowest animal selfish tendencies to pure consciousness, cosmic governance, or divine prevalence. Islam highlights what so many earlier prophets and sages before Muhammad had emphasised and tried to inculcate in their people and cultures.","title":"Life, Death and Change"},{"location":"articles/pointers-to-haqq/#unity","text":"The crucial issue is the unitive nature of truth and reality or God as the source of life and all creation, and this cosmic source is also the final destiny. Everything has emanated from that essence and returns to it. The teachings of the Qur\u2019an and the way of Muhammad also highlight the purpose of human existence and its transient nature from the lower self to the divine soul itself, from birth to death, all of which is in preparation for the full unveiling of Truth after death \u2013 eternal cosmic connectedness. Death is a most natural transfer from dualities and confinement within space and time to eternal oneness. The Qur\u2019an reveals that real life is ever continuous and not subject to beginnings or ends, such as birth and death. We experience, in fact, two modes of birth and death. One birth is physical, biological and emotional, and the other one is awakening to the ultimate truth, which is the nature of our own soul. This spiritual birth is the essential drive within all human desires and hopes, the source of which can be accessed and touched upon through transcendence of all sensory experiences and conditioned consciousness. A preparation for this is meditation, contemplation, silence and solitude. The Qur\u2019an and prophetic teachings emphasise the duty and purpose of human beings, which is to transcend the lower self to the divine soul in preparation for ongoingness in the hereafter. Real education and grooming evolves us to act as accountable and responsible earthly stewards \u2013 the master is the divine soul. All our life experiences are practices towards higher infinite consciousness, and the many grades, scales, zones and domains that it encompasses. All of this will be experienced fully after a period of the rattling and shaking of purification after death, described by most world religions. The Abrahamic religions are clear about heaven, hell and purgatory. Others have similar teachings, including that of reincarnation \u2013 if you haven\u2019t succeeded in transcending to higher consciousness then you will return. All world religions have some notion that if you have not progressed sufficiently towards higher consciousness before death then there is going to be a \u2019decompression\u2019 so that whatever you have carried within yourself as traces and fantasies is eradicated. But if you have practiced eradication, like the Buddhist practice of death with its eight different stages, then it is a natural progression towards liberation from the illusion of separation.","title":"Unity"},{"location":"articles/pointers-to-haqq/#practicing-surrender","text":"Islam, like some other world religions, prescribes practices that elevate consciousness through reflecting upon day-to-day habits, which are otherwise performed without full attention or reflection. The human purpose on earth is to ascend in consciousness from a very basic survival level to illumined awakening and arrival. When self-awareness becomes a natural constant habit, then every moment becomes enriched with vibrancy and delight. Religious practices and rituals are the beginnings of alignment between self and soul and transcending the material world to higher consciousness. Formally, you pray five times a day (which also has an important social aspect to it) until, as the Qur\u2019an describes, you are perpetually in that plugged-in state. The same applies to all other rituals. In a sense, you are at all times on pilgrimage. While with fasting, you are at all times aware of what you are putting in your mouth or what you are putting in your head. So let this month be different from other months, even if you cannot fast. Whatever you ingest, be aware of it, be more conscious of it. Marvel at how it is possible for you to lift your hand or even a finger. Enter the magic of this month so that all year round you will be aware of where you are sitting, why you are drinking, where you put your cup. Your whole life then becomes an act of worship. Life has to flow. It has to be fun and we all seek and hope for that. Initially with a child there is a little bribery and corruption \u2013 \u2018Do it for mummy\u2019s sake\u2019. But later on, by being in the dot of the now, by being present, you are already participating in the treasures of eternal life. If you are truly practicing silence and awareness of the moment and its immensity, then you know time and non-time; the eternal and the short, all lie in that moment. So you will know that the present moment, of which you are experiencing a little of its coming and its going, is perfect. You will know that the present moment contains within it eternity. You will know it is perfect. Bring that to the social level and you will never ever lament the difficulties of today \u2013 the bad culture, people don\u2019t listen, children are rebellious, etc. You must not regurgitate what you have been reiterating from the past. Read it. It will tell you. There is utter perfection in the moment; therefore, if you take today\u2019s time, you will recognise it is much better than ten years ago and much much better than a hundred years ago. This is a touchstone of contentment. The present moment contains all that happened in the past and gives a clear indication of what will happen in the future. By denying the perfection of the moment we will lack contentment and happiness will remain elusive. Divisions and differences between human beings are natural. So is our love for harmony and unity. Every one of us experiences constant change within space and time whilst we seek perspective and refer to higher consciousness with its boundless constancy. No two moments are the same for any living entity. Within each moment is the duality of what is attractive and what is not. Each and every living entity can act like a war machine with animosity and discord whilst wishing for peace and goodness, albeit in the distant future. How can we overcome enmity and discord, and accept differences in opinion, culture, or way of life, as natural occurrences just like the countless plants, flowers, flavors and colors? All humans are similar in many ways but also differ in other ways. No matter what we do, no matter what we say, every person and every people have a flavour. Reference to higher consciousness will put things in perspective and will show you the appropriate path.","title":"Practicing Surrender"},{"location":"articles/pointers-to-haqq/#lasting-contentment","text":"Peace and prosperity can only become durable when inner peace and contentment is attained when the self becomes subservient to the soul, thereby accessing timeless joy. Peace and prosperity become socially durable and universal when personal inner peace and contentment is attained by a number of people who have an influence over the community and society, and their guidance becomes a touchstone for normal conduct and behaviour. In the past, religious people, saints, sages and others were regarded as the ultimate reference points and arbiters when there were serious differences and disputes between people and communities. In our day-to-day life today we need the wisdom of perspective, durable goodness and true accountability regarding intentions and actions. The supreme treasure of all is the divine spirit within the heart, which is the ultimate guiding reference for fulfilled living. When a mature person is in constant attention, reflection and reference to the higher level of consciousness, then fulfillment is attained in the world of duality, change and uncertainty. This awakened being is constantly energised by permanent life and therefore regards death as a natural ascent to the liberated zone of eternal presence. Fears and sorrows become insignificant and the nature of death reveals itself to be a gift of liberation from the limitations of the earthly journey. Our limited world of dualities drives us to understand the cause and effect, origin and destiny, of all that exists in preparation for the state beyond death, beyond self-identity and the illusion of independence or separation from sacred oneness. Most of what we experience in nature is complementary and symbiotic and even where there appears to be divergence, nature acts to regulate the natural flow of diversities in life. With the human urge to investigate, study and discover the nature of material objects as well as feelings and emotions, we reach the conclusion that the entire of existence is differentiated sameness. No two moments are the same but the nature of time and space remains the same. If you simply live totally in the now then you are directly energised by higher eternal consciousness. Now is forever and so is the inner soul or spirit. So hasten with patience. Wait, especially if you are in a rush.","title":"Lasting Contentment"},{"location":"articles/pointers-to-haqq/#celebrate","text":"It is human nature to be hopeful, cheerful and to celebrate goodness. Most people use any excuse to celebrate and leave behind sorrow, fear, or insecurity. We all love to celebrate \u2013 it is deep in the human psyche. Individually we celebrate within ourselves because that is our kingdom, and collectively with the wider kingdom. Celebration is victory, and victory is beyond success and failure. But we end up having pseudo-celebrations, like birthdays or the \u2018independence\u2019 of a country. We need to ask ourselves what is it that is worthy of celebration at all times and all occasions without any bitterness or regrets later on? Celebration is only going to be meaningful through Islam, Iman and Ihsan. Each is a zone of consciousness. Islam is that there is nothing in my hand; I didn\u2019t know who I was, I didn\u2019t know what was birth, I don\u2019t know what death is, so I have to surrender into the vast unknown. Iman is that I trust that it has been going on for millions of years so there must be some stability, some referencing, some governorship. That is Iman; I have faith, I have trust, I can rely upon the perfection that emerges from the unseen, whether experienced or not. Ihsan is that there is no \u2018me\u2019 anymore \u2013 there is only perfection; so if I am truly basking in that perfection I cannot but transmit that with which I have been saturated. Life is glorious and we celebrate it perpetually.","title":"Celebrate!"},{"location":"articles/practice-stillness/","text":"The Practice of Stillness Generally there are three stages in the practice of stillness in body, mind, and heart. 1. Preparation and Intention This preliminary stage is intended to help you overcome the natural mental noise that goes on in your head. Anything that exists seeks to perpetuate itself. All thoughts are froth from the neuron circuitry, so allow them to exhaust themselves and leave you. Ensure that the possibilities for being interrupted are kept to a minimum and that your attention is not diverted to worldly needs. As you do your wudu concentrate on the meaning of every movement, using each one as an opportunity to purify the decaying body (see Transformative Worship for more on this). Sound is a powerful tool when used repetitively as a way of tricking the mind through self-hypnosis to reduce the circling of thoughts and bring them to one point. It is not so much the intensity of being mindful but the frequency and constancy. This approach incorporates any of a dozen methodologies or ways. Recitation of Qur\u2019an Sit quietly and follow a recitation or read aloud yourself. Repeat only a few ayat of your choice. Dhikr This is an opportunity to leave behind your identity, your biography, your worries. Choose a dhikr that is effective for you. Recite the Name \u2018Allah\u2019 in any fashion, or any other Divines Names. For example, if you are ill \u2018Ya Sh\u0101f\u012b Ya Mu\u2019\u0101f\u012b\u2019 may be helpful; if worried for provisions, \u2018Ya Fatt\u0101h Ya Razz\u0101q\u2018. Visualisation Visualize anything you are comfortable and familiar with, such as a divine name on the horizon, a colour, rainbows etc. Whatever you choose, concentrate on it. For example, take a rose in your hand and ask it permission to de-petal it. Your mind is a trickster; you have to outwit it. Breath Become aware of inhaling and exhaling, extending the period of exhalation. 2. Entering the Ocean The moment you have made your intention you are on the shore wading in, in the hope that the sea will engulf you and that you will lose all self-consciousness, self-awareness and identity. In Muslim cultures, certain terms were used to denote meditative retreats, such as khalwa (which connotes a status and prestige that is quite misplaced and abused in this day and age), i\u2019tik\u0101f (which has remained a tradition practised during the last 10 days of Ramadan) and \u2018uzla (a more neutral term denoting setting oneself aside). Whilst wading through the shallows, many aspects of the self will be revealed to you. Allow them to emerge, face them with courage, and allow them to exhaust themselves. When dealing with aspects of your shadow, it is useful to imagine that you are in the guesthouse described by Rumi, welcoming each without judgement, and then eventually watching them recede. Persist and be patient and do not judge your progress because this zone takes the bulk of energy and time. 3. Transcending Space and Time As you are wading, there may be occasions when you slip or lose your foothold; do not panic but be patient. Now you are approaching the deep end: experiencing different qualities of silence. Flow with that state with trust but no fear. You are now entering a zone of higher consciousness that is at the edge of truth. All these approaches will help move you along towards higher consciousness. The Origin Ultimately, we're seeking the origin for everything. How did it come about? How did an insect evolve to become what it is? What is the origin of an idea? How did the notion of God come about? What is the origin of life? Who am I descended from? Maybe there was a great being or hero among my ancestors. Perhaps that is why I feel special! We want to identify with power, honour and glory. This quest is within conditioned consciousness. What, however, is the origin of the seed of questing origin? That primal drive is inseparable from life, consciousness and the root and origin of the beginning of creation. We have evolved to be aware of awareness itself. Consider the four main substances: fire, water, air and earth. Fire and light are at the root of conscious life. Our nervous system depends upon electromagnetic actions upon neurons. Without air for a few minutes, the brain is dead. Without water and all the minerals, we cannot survive. Our origin is cosmic and we have within us all of the attributes of cosmic dust and lights. Over a hundred different elements. Our physical survival, depends upon other living creatures, animals and plants. We maintain ourselves by eating fruit and roots and vegetables whose origin is dust, water, air and sun. But human survival needs more than earth and water \u2013 our life is dependent on more basic forms of life. Within conditioned consciousness, we question, reflect, share, and try to discover what the original cause is. Once we are at the point of neutrality, then the light of inner perception beams from the Soul, reflecting the divine spirit of the Origin. The question is replaced with a taste of Reality and the experience of Oneness \u2013 a glorious answer which ends all questions \u2013 your personal entity is now in inseparable connection with the Cosmic Reality.","title":"The Practice of Stillness"},{"location":"articles/practice-stillness/#the-practice-of-stillness","text":"Generally there are three stages in the practice of stillness in body, mind, and heart.","title":"The Practice of Stillness"},{"location":"articles/practice-stillness/#1-preparation-and-intention","text":"This preliminary stage is intended to help you overcome the natural mental noise that goes on in your head.

Like other seekers before and after him, he went to solitary places for his periods of reflection. For the true seeker, this is not escapism, but a direct, positive attempt to find out where he comes from by reflecting upon what is closest to him, that is, his own self. Finally, he may reach a point of neutrality in which hardly any more of that self is left and it has been recognized in all its aspects by the seeker. He will have seen every angle of the so-called personality. The Black Stone of the Ka\u2018bah When this has been seen, the seeker moves on single-pointedly to blacking out, symbolized by the Black Stone of the Ka\u2018bah. It's important to understand this symbol more deeply. We live in duality, and we seek to neutralize, but how do we neutralize? We neutralize our nafs by remaining silent , genuinely and positively. In that silence we have direct knowledge of the meaning of the Black Stone which is set into the corner of the Ka\u2018bah in Mecca. Few Muslims know the meaning of the Black Stone, even though they perform the rite of circling it and kissing it during the \u1e24ajj (pilgrimage) every year. Black contains all the colors \u2014 it symbolizes death, from which comes life. Life cannot be understood unless one is willing to die. Thus the Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , moves toward a state of no attributes, reaching, as the Sufis say, close to the suns of essence, moving away from the stars of attributes. First, he quietens his actions. Next, he moves into a subtler realm of attributes, and from there he crosses the boundary of essence. From that point on, one is traversing another realm. This process is not directly discernable or describable; another set of rules begins to apply. It is a no-man\u2019s land where no one can help anybody else, except by discussing its outer boundaries. It is an experiential state that everyone interprets differently. It is like an event which causes a great shock and which everybody tries to describe in a different language. It is a taste, a higher taste; it is a great opening. It is the explosive germination of the heart. Die Before You Die This opening is, of course, devastating as we see from what happened to Sayyidna Musa, \u2018alayhi-s-sal\u0101m . It is a shattering experience; it is not simply another experience of life, but rather of another realm. We can only go so far in understanding knowledge and information regarding our realm of consciousness which is in fact an aspect of a higher consciousness. It is like the story of a person who lives under water. He has a good consciousness of what is under water and he understands what goes on there. He may also have had quite a lot of glimpses of what is above water. But it is a different experience to actually be above water. No matter how much he may be prepared for it, it still is a shock, and when this occurred to the Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , he was in such a state of shock that some people even said he had gone mad. As a method for dealing with the views of others, the Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , often emphasized the importance of remembrance of death and being prepared for it at all times. \u2018Die before you die\u2019 is a frequently quoted tradition. The general meaning of the teaching is to be ready to leave this world in submission to the will of the generous and just God with ease and peace of mind. This state is attained by having the least amount of attachments to, and love of, worldly belongings and relationships. A deeper meaning is to let the lower consciousness die (\u2018lower life\u2019 is often quoted in the Qur\u2019an) and to live for and by the higher (\u2018other\u2019, \u2018later\u2019 or \u2018lasting\u2019 life), which relates to God consciousness. These teachings and Qur\u2019anic verses become transformative when one reflects and meditates upon the purpose and meaning of life and the human freedom and responsibility. Islam is the path of grooming the lower self and purifying the heart and unifying the self and soul. This spiritual evolvement will lift the individual consciousness out of the ever-changing worldly uncertainties to the domain of insights and inner delights. Whatever we love in this world we shall lose, except the sacred soul which lives on. When we remember that the end may come at any minute and we remember that we are suspended in air (one word related to nafs is nafas , meaning breath), we become more human. The Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , said, \u201cPeople are asleep, and when they die they wake up.\u201d True seekers want to die while being awake \u2014 they want to enter a state of total silence. All the practices of the men of Allah from time immemorial lead man, the seeker, to inner death while still alive. If, while we are conscious, aware, and scintillating with life, we can enter a state of self-abandonment, then we will understand what inner death is. If we cannot reach this state, then we will remain in the turmoil of sa\u2018y, that is, running between \u1e62af\u0101 and Marwah in Mecca.","title":"The Shock of Awakening"},{"location":"articles/shock-awakening/#the-shock-of-awakening","text":"By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri from the book \u201cBeams of Illumination from the Divine Revelation \u2013 A Commentary on the Last Section of the Qur\u2019an\u201d By the time the first five ayat of Surat-ul-\u2018Alaq were revealed to him, the Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , had already been regularly spending days, weeks, and months in meditation in a cave in order to penetrate the layers of his nafs , thereby following the path of all those before him who followed the dictum: \u201cHe who knows himself knows his Lord.\u201d The path towards the knowledge of lordship, of sustainership, is by way of the recognition of what is closest to us, which is all the different selves, or aspects of ourselves.

A deeper meaning is to let the lower consciousness die (\u2018lower life\u2019 is often quoted in the Qur\u2019an) and to live for and by the higher (\u2018other\u2019, \u2018later\u2019 or \u2018lasting\u2019 life), which relates to God consciousness. These teachings and Qur\u2019anic verses become transformative when one reflects and meditates upon the purpose and meaning of life and the human freedom and responsibility. Islam is the path of grooming the lower self and purifying the heart and unifying the self and soul. This spiritual evolvement will lift the individual consciousness out of the ever-changing worldly uncertainties to the domain of insights and inner delights. Whatever we love in this world we shall lose, except the sacred soul which lives on. When we remember that the end may come at any minute and we remember that we are suspended in air (one word related to nafs is nafas , meaning breath), we become more human. The Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , said, \u201cPeople are asleep, and when they die they wake up.\u201d True seekers want to die while being awake \u2014 they want to enter a state of total silence. All the practices of the men of Allah from time immemorial lead man, the seeker, to inner death while still alive. If, while we are conscious, aware, and scintillating with life, we can enter a state of self-abandonment, then we will understand what inner death is. If we cannot reach this state, then we will remain in the turmoil of sa\u2018y, that is, running between \u1e62af\u0101 and Marwah in Mecca.","title":"Die Before You Die"},{"location":"articles/sufism-sufi/","text":"Sufism and the Sufi By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, from the book \"The Thoughtful Guide to Sufism\" . What is relevant to us today about Sufism is that it has maintained a clear thread and line of direct transmission of wisdom back to original Islam. The key to Sufism is that of inner awakening, freedom and joy through recognition of outer restriction by choice and discrimination. \u2026 The reason that the majority of current studies on Sufism are of little use in a practical sense is because of the nature of inner awakening itself, which is the core of Sufism. Writing books about inner awakening is only really possible if one has experienced it, just as understanding of such books is only really possible if one genuinely desires, or has already attained, such awakening. The Sufi is the locus of connecting the outer, physical reality with a timeless, spaceless dimension which is experienced within the self. The Sufi lives like the tip of the iceberg which is apparent in the seen world, while experiencing aspects of the hidden and veiled world which is the foundation of what is visible, and which forms the rest of its reality. He does his best to understand the causal, physical outer life while awakening to an immense inner Reality, which encompasses both the known and the unknown worlds, the unitive Reality of the seen and the unseen, of time and space and non-time-space. It is for this reason that the inner life of the Sufi has no bounds, and yet he acknowledges and accepts the outer bounds with courtesy towards nature and the natural creation. The Sufi is totally content with the immeasurable bliss within. Yet he struggles outwardly towards a better quality of life on earth and does his best without being overly concerned about the ultimate results. Outer struggle and work are necessary companions to inner purification and contentment. Genuine Sufis are essentially similar wherever they come from, in that they share an inner light and awakening, and an outer courtesy and service to humanity. Apparent differences between Sufis tend to relate to matters concerning spiritual practices or prescriptions for the purification of hearts. The sweet fruit of Sufism is the same. It is only the trees which may look different and which may flower in different seasons. In this work, we have tried to show that those who claim that it is possible to have Sufism without Islam are only looking at one side of the story. Inner purity is generally attainable, but without its being contained outwardly, it will not result in any real flourishing of a spiritual culture or an enlightened environment. Inner light and joy may be sufficient for an individual living in a cave, but once we start interacting with others, we need to know where and what the bounds are for that social interaction to be able to take place, and this is where we find that the laws of Islam are necessary and inseparable from Sufism. Emptying Out, Sweetening, Purifying The first step for a seeker to take is to witness, pure and simple. It is to be watchful, to be aware, to allow that which is higher in you to enable you to witness what goes on within you. In the state of watchfulness, at the beginning, there is usually a storm of thoughts. With guidance and perseverance, these bubbles of thoughts surface and vanish. This is the stage of emptying out. It is the cleaning of the mind-processor so that no psychological or emotional memories remain to contaminate the mind-computer. Then begins the process of sweetening. In order to achieve the ability to connect with the inner central core of one\u2019s self at any time and in any place, one needs to be sweetened. It is a process of displacement. It is like a bucket of muddy water which becomes purified by placing it under a running tap of sweet, clean water, until all the mud in the water has been displaced and the water in the bucket purified. The speed at which the tap flows depends on the size and capacity of the bucket. This is where a teacher is required for help. If the seeker is ready, the teacher simply pushes him into the ocean of awakening, which is what happened with Shaykh Abu\u2019l Hasan ash-Shadhili. When he reached his teacher, after having already mastered all the outer knowledges of Islam, he was simply asked to renew his ritual purification through washing. His spiritual master, Shaykh Abd as-Salam ibn Mashish, told him to descend the mountain and renew his ritual purification through washing and then to return, When Shaykh ash-Shadhili returned, it only took one look from his spiritual master for him to understand the meaning of all that had gone on before and after and the purpose of the meeting between the two of them. The seeker recognized the teacher and the teacher recognized the seeker instantaneously. However, there are those seekers who need continuous sweetening, encouragement and guidance before inward purification can occur. So sweetening is a process which is followed by purification. In actual life these three processes \u2013 emptying out, sweetening and purification \u2013 are carried out and take place simultaneously. They are three dimensions of the same process as they reinforce each other, leading toward the desired end result. They all go hand in hand. Surrendering Attachment Nothing is wrong with the world. There is nothing wrong with the creation. Everything is in a perfect form in its perfect place at the perfect time. It is my attitude towards it which causes me pain. The postman arrives and there is a letter for me informing me that a house in the countryside, which I love, has burned down and the roof has caved in. Those wonderful antique paintings are completely ruined. I am ruined! The Sufi says: \"You have to surrender. There is nothing wrong with the house provided that when it collapses, you do not collapse with it. It is the surrendering of the ownership/attachment aspect of it. The fact is, you can only carry out an activity efficiently if you are not attached to it. You can only run a business efficiently if you are not attached to it.\" The seeds of all emotional attributes are in us inwardly, otherwise we could not comprehend them when we see them outwardly. The seed of fear is in us, thus we all know what fear is. We all understand what pain is. We all understand what anger is. We understand all these things because we are all from the same source. We are all creatures of God, we have come from God and to God we return. We have all been created in the same manner with the same consciousness. We are all sons and daughters of Adam. And, therefore, from that point of view, \u2018I\u2019 the individual, the microcosm, reflect and contain the characteristics of the macrocosm. This is my little world and that is the entire world. But in my little world are to be found the miniatures of the outside world, and, therefore, the secrets of the outside world. We say we are looking for self-fulfilment. So there is nothing other than your own self-fulfilment. And that can only come when your mind is quiet. Conclusion The relevance of Sufism today is greater than it has been in any other age, for nowadays we can cross cultural and political boundaries much more easily, because of ease of access through communications, travel and closeness of the world. The message of Sufism is more urgent now, especially due to the fact that the world is increasingly becoming bound by materialism and consumerism. The awakening to the inner life of man is a necessary condition of his fulfillment as a human being. It comes as the pinnacle of his struggle with the elements and the fulfillment of his basic needs. Once our outer needs are met, then the inner must also be fulfilled. The two are so interlinked that those who are awakened to both the outer and inner realities see them as inseparable and continuous in the one creational, unific truth. The heart of an awakened being reflects the entire universe and such a being is described by the Sufi master, Ibn Arabi, in these words: My heart has become capable of every form: It is a pasture for gazelles, And a monastery for Christian monks, And a temple for idols, And the pilgrim\u2019s Ka\u2019bah, And the tablets of the Torah, And the Book of the Qur\u2018an.

The internet and other media makes this easily accessible to all, rather than being the preserve of the few. This has had a huge impact on understanding of Sufi tariqas, masters and their teachings. The clear discipline and teachings of the great Sufi masters, such as Ibn \u2018Ata\u2019 Allah al- Iskandari, Abdullah Ansari, Ibn al-\u2018Arabi and Mulla Sadra, can help any serious spiritual seeker. Original Islam can now be practiced and lived by most people without fear of retribution from unjust and rigid authorities, who impose uniformity of thought in their fear of losing control over people\u2019s minds and hearts. The rise of social networking and the internet has made access to this rich heritage easy, though one has to sift through the sites judiciously for authentic and transformative teachings. During the past few decades research projects on the lives and teachings of numerous Sufi Shaykhs and spiritual masters have become popular. These studies have come out of European or American universities with a few from the east. Metaphysical poetry and spiritual songs have also been rediscovered and made public by literary and spiritually-oriented individuals and organizations. It is not an accident that Rumi has for many years been so frequently quoted and read in the West and is one of the best-selling poets in the States, probably in large part due to the interpretive translations of Coleman Barks and others. These are all signs that our scientific and material development is reaching a point that needs the revitalization of the heart and awakening to the inner light of the soul. Normal human consciousness is beginning to be regarded as one of many strands of accessible consciousness, starting from the local and conditioned state to full and boundless light of the cosmic consciousness \u2013 Allah. The golden thread amongst all of these works is the constant reference to an Essence or Reality that transcends all that is discerned by human senses and the mind. The idea of God being the preserve of a specific religion or people is being superseded by the durable idea of universal Oneness or supreme consciousness. Muslims, especially the Sufis, have constantly referred to the return to the truth that there is only one unique Essence (Allah, God) in creation and that everything else is simply an overflow of grace and manifestation of that primal light. Whatever there is in existence has a trace of its origin in it. Whatever is born will also die. This encourages the mind to reflect on what is eternally present and constant whilst also experiencing change and the dualities in creation. Whenever I asked an enlightened teacher what my duties in life ought to be, I received the same answer: as long as your focus is upon reducing your personal concern or \u2018separate identity\u2019, you are on the right track of liberating yourself from your \u2018lower\u2019 self. The Prophet Musa was ordered to take off his sandals (symbolizing protection and separation) before the Burning Bush. When personal identity or the illusion of independence is lost to a higher consciousness, then every moment and every place is sacred. For those, who have the will and interest to transcend the limitations of body and mind, the opportunities exist today, as they have always done. Sacredness is what holds the universe and consciousness of life. Humans are driven to realize the highest level of consciousness. Sufism is a natural human expression of the quest for knowledge of what connects and unifies the universe in all its diversity; the links of the seen and the unseen \u2013 the thread of Truth. Understanding Unity (Tawhid) Allah says: \"You are certainly on a clear path, a straight and direct way\" Qur'an, 36:04 The \u2018straight path\u2019 ( al-sirat al-mustaqim ) is the shortest distance between two points, between subject and object, between man and Allah. That is why it is direct, for it stretches from man to what he is always seeking, which is the All-Encompassing Reality. The understanding of unity (tawhid) is the straight path (al-sirat al-mustaqim), but it cannot be the subject of mere intellectual study. One must move along the path of submission (islam), through belief (iman) to sublime excellence (ihsan), until one begins to have glimpses of unity, through which one can then dive into the world of meaning. If the goal of unity ( tawhid ) is not constantly present in the minds of the Muslims, their Islam becomes diluted and falls by the wayside. Mosques become either totally empty or only superficially full, because most of the people there are attending only as a matter of form. In many parts of the Muslim world this is what one finds, because the path is no longer about remembrance of Allah ( dhikru\u2019llah ), nor about wanting knowledge of Allah. In many places Islam itself has been put on a pedestal and is being worshipped instead of Allah. Islam, however, is a means to the knowledge of Allah, not the object itself. We all love what is timeless. We all love what is absolute. Does anyone not want to live forever, past this life and on into the next? This means that we all love the One Who is forever living. The love of Allah, therefore, is already in our hearts, but we become diverted, we rationalize: \u2018Not now, tomorrow or next year, when I finish with this or that business.\u2019 We blame other people for our lack of time and all our other problems as well.

In a similar way, there are two versions of being alive. Conditioned Consciousness The first version is the simple awareness of being a living, breathing human being; this is sentiency. We say, \u201cI am alive because I am conscious and through that consciousness I can manipulate my hand or my movement\u201d. This is the definition and experience of conditioned consciousness. It is the idea of having your own life and asking, \u201cWhat are you doing with your life?\u201d It\u2019s the idea that \u201clife is precious\u201d \u201ctime is precious\u201d \u201ceverything will pass\u201d \u201cyou only have one life to live\u201d. This places us in a box where we remain anchored to our perception of what \u201cour life\u201d is. It is this box that causes the fear, anxiety and concern when reflecting on the inevitable cycle of birth and death. Combined Consciousness The second version of being alive is when limited, conditioned life, is combined with Life itself. This is truly being alive. To understand this better we first need to again consider the experience of limited consciousness and limited life. Rabbit consciousness, chimpanzee consciousness and intelligent philosopher consciousness are all limited, conditioned \u2018consciousness\u2019s\u2019. Each is different in its own way, and each is constantly changing through every moment. In the same way, each person experiences their own life and consciousness as constantly changing. Within this field of constant change we also experience everything as good or bad. Yet, we may have fooled ourselves into thinking that anything can really ever be good or bad. Lets take bright light as an example. Bright light may be too hot and too bright and therefore be judged, in a particular moment, as bad. But it is not the light that is bad; it is the perception of the light that is bad. The light itself is beyond judgements of good or bad, it is simply light. If the perception of light does not lead to the discovery of infinite light then I am not alive. And if I am not alive, then all the moments where I had joy are inconsequential because they have not lead me to the ultimate mine of joys that I can plug into. Only experience of the infinite light, beyond individual perception and judgement, will ever be good enough. In perceiving light, I have been given a small jewel that was brought from the mine of infinite light, and if I have no access to the mine, it is not good enough. What we all really seek is that which is permanently continuous and permanently connected. We do not want anything that may abruptly end. With any apparent disconnection, with any break from the infinite light we feel sad, we feel depressed. So human purpose, above the purpose of daily tasks and ambitions, is only to connect your life with Life itself. Connect your life with the Life from which your life is drawing its energy. If that is done, all is done. If that is not done, nothing is ever enough. Otherness and Oneness From mysterious Oneness, a plethora of every type of energy, matter and other realities emerged as every imaginable energy, material form, cycles or patterns in dualities, that balance each other. Pluralities emanate from the One and return to the One. Dualities appear as opposites or complimentary. They are twins. The two quarreling traders appear opposite to each other. Whereas in fact they are competing for what seems to them of limited availability. Dualities confirm unity. Disagreements and differences are due to perceiving otherness. He is not one of us; not the same religion, not the same nation. Even when obsessed by the desire to perceive through Oneness. Eyesight, memory and habit mask this Truth. The genesis of the veil of otherness is conditioned consciousness of human beings for survival. You notice mostly that which is different and ignore the familiar. The herder noticed somebody else with his goats and felt threatened. Animal survival needs. Otherness enforces the animal self for survival, protection and earthly ongoingness. Once you have actually experienced forever-ness of your own Soul then there would be a considerable erosion of the feeling of otherness. The awakened person sees sameness of essence and outer differences. The enlightened person only sees through the lens of Oneness. Reflective people become more aware of the light of the Soul.

In a similar way, there are two versions of being alive.","title":"To Be Alive"},{"location":"articles/to-be-alive/#conditioned-consciousness","text":"The first version is the simple awareness of being a living, breathing human being; this is sentiency. We say, \u201cI am alive because I am conscious and through that consciousness I can manipulate my hand or my movement\u201d. This is the definition and experience of conditioned consciousness. It is the idea of having your own life and asking, \u201cWhat are you doing with your life?\u201d It\u2019s the idea that \u201clife is precious\u201d \u201ctime is precious\u201d \u201ceverything will pass\u201d \u201cyou only have one life to live\u201d. This places us in a box where we remain anchored to our perception of what \u201cour life\u201d is. It is this box that causes the fear, anxiety and concern when reflecting on the inevitable cycle of birth and death.","title":"Conditioned Consciousness"},{"location":"articles/to-be-alive/#combined-consciousness","text":"The second version of being alive is when limited, conditioned life, is combined with Life itself. This is truly being alive. To understand this better we first need to again consider the experience of limited consciousness and limited life. Rabbit consciousness, chimpanzee consciousness and intelligent philosopher consciousness are all limited, conditioned \u2018consciousness\u2019s\u2019. Each is different in its own way, and each is constantly changing through every moment. In the same way, each person experiences their own life and consciousness as constantly changing. Within this field of constant change we also experience everything as good or bad. Yet, we may have fooled ourselves into thinking that anything can really ever be good or bad. Lets take bright light as an example. Bright light may be too hot and too bright and therefore be judged, in a particular moment, as bad. But it is not the light that is bad; it is the perception of the light that is bad. The light itself is beyond judgements of good or bad, it is simply light. If the perception of light does not lead to the discovery of infinite light then I am not alive. And if I am not alive, then all the moments where I had joy are inconsequential because they have not lead me to the ultimate mine of joys that I can plug into. Only experience of the infinite light, beyond individual perception and judgement, will ever be good enough. In perceiving light, I have been given a small jewel that was brought from the mine of infinite light, and if I have no access to the mine, it is not good enough. What we all really seek is that which is permanently continuous and permanently connected. We do not want anything that may abruptly end. With any apparent disconnection, with any break from the infinite light we feel sad, we feel depressed. So human purpose, above the purpose of daily tasks and ambitions, is only to connect your life with Life itself. Connect your life with the Life from which your life is drawing its energy. If that is done, all is done. If that is not done, nothing is ever enough.","title":"Combined Consciousness"},{"location":"articles/to-be-alive/#otherness-and-oneness","text":"From mysterious Oneness, a plethora of every type of energy, matter and other realities emerged as every imaginable energy, material form, cycles or patterns in dualities, that balance each other. Pluralities emanate from the One and return to the One. Dualities appear as opposites or complimentary. They are twins. The two quarreling traders appear opposite to each other. Whereas in fact they are competing for what seems to them of limited availability. Dualities confirm unity. Disagreements and differences are due to perceiving otherness. He is not one of us; not the same religion, not the same nation. Even when obsessed by the desire to perceive through Oneness. Eyesight, memory and habit mask this Truth. The genesis of the veil of otherness is conditioned consciousness of human beings for survival. You notice mostly that which is different and ignore the familiar. The herder noticed somebody else with his goats and felt threatened. Animal survival needs. Otherness enforces the animal self for survival, protection and earthly ongoingness. Once you have actually experienced forever-ness of your own Soul then there would be a considerable erosion of the feeling of otherness. The awakened person sees sameness of essence and outer differences. The enlightened person only sees through the lens of Oneness. Reflective people become more aware of the light of the Soul. Life is work in progress. Otherness is a reminder of Oneness. Otherness is an outer encrustation or shell that has within it, the light of Oneness. The root of everything is Oneness.

Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri has sought to furnish the reader with the fundamental elements and insights into the make-up of the individual self and how the various elements and dualistic interplay of spirituality and humanity interact within us.","title":"Sufism and Self-Knowledge"},{"location":"books/sufism/#titles","text":"The Thoughtful Guide to Sufism Read It The Sufi Way of Self-Enfoldment Read It The Sayings Wisdom of Imam \u2019Ali Read It Sufi Encounters Read It Elements of Sufism Read It Witnessing Perfection Read It The Lantern of the Path Read It The Hikam Read It","title":"Titles"},{"location":"books/sufism/elements-sufism/","text":"The Elements of Sufism Summary Sufism is the heart of Islam.

The Qur'an provides more insight: \u201cSay: Travel in the earth and see how He makes the first creation, then Allah creates the latter creation; surely Allah has power over all things.\u201d \u2013 29:20 In every way it is a blessing to travel. In the Shadhili tariqa , the masters never slept in one place for more than three weeks, so as not to take what was around them for granted. Haraka ma\u2019a-l-baraka : movement is with blessing. Man must change, he must move on so that he does not become a slave of outer habits and become fixated. Man is attracted to fixation because he loves the permanent, the ever-fixed within him. But to desire preservation of outer fixation is ignorance. The outer can never be fixed. No sooner does man try to control an event than he finds it beyond his power to do so. Man wants to know the permanent but he mistakenly tries to bring it about in his environment by establishing rigid habits. At the lowest, most superficial level, travel disturbs this tendency. The earth would be sterile if it were not disturbed, if it were not plowed. The same thing applies to man\u2019s heart. If it is not disturbed, if it is not cut off from its desires and attachments, how can it resonate and keep turning? At first one resents being cut off, but the purpose of one\u2019s life is to move both outwardly and inwardly; outwardly by having dynamic attitudes toward the world and the earth, and inwardly by being willing to turn away from what the self desires. Hajj The word hajj literally means \"endeavor, aspiration, intention, destination, object, goal, aim\". In Islam it means: \u2018to intend to go to the House of Allah to carry out specific rituals which are to be executed within a certain time frame.\u2019 In a spiritual sense hajj is endeavoring to reach a station whose meaning, magnitude and true essence cannot be expressed or explained because of the lack of words to describe it. For this reason there are few who speak of it. In The Lantern of the Path , Imam Ja`far al\u2011Sadiq said: \"If you want to make the Pilgrimage then empty your heart before your departure of every distraction and concealing veil and turn all your affairs over to your Creator and trust in Him\u2026\" \"\u2026then wash your sins away with the water of sincere repentance and don the garments of truth, purity and humility.\" `Umrah This is the voluntary visit to the Ka`bah at other times of the year. The word `umrah is from the Arabic three letter root `AMR, which means to construct, build and inhabit, implying \u2018flourishing, inhabiting, giving life to, populating, and building\u2019. Thus, `umrah means to cause to flourish and to be enlivened by one\u2019s presence at the Ka`bah. The Ka`bah is a metaphor for divine impenetrability and for this reason there is no fear for the one who is present there. It is the Fortress of Eternal Truth \u2013 everlasting and perfect. Whoever performs the `Umrah is not obliged to perform the Pause at `Arafah, but only the Taw\u0101f and the Hastening Between Stations, and does not leave Makkah before visiting the House many times. This represents the passion for Allah\u2019s Names and Attributes which encompass the universe and the Ka`bah is its centre. Going to Madinah and to the Presence of Muhammad is not considered complementary to the House of Allah, because the prophetic presence is a manifestation of the Presence of Oneness. The enlightened seeker sees through the Muhammadi Presence, and his spiritual insight witnesses the Presence of Oneness \u2013 the Unique Absolute One. As his outer is within the shari`ah, his soul is within the tariqah and his Innermost is within the haqiqah. Reflecting upon \u2018Muhammad the Messenger of Allah \u2019 will reveal that \u2018Muhammad\u2019 represents the Physical Universe and the \u2018Messenger\u2019 (ras\u016bl) represents the Spiritual Realms, and that \u2018Allah\u2019 represents the Realm of Power. Thus, whoever knows the haqiqah of Muhammad knows the entire truth. Muhrim The muhrim (one who is in a state of ihr\u0101m ) journeys in a state of complete obedience, calling out the words of the talbiyah : \"Labayka\" (Here I am, at Your service!), until s/he arrives at the Ka`bah, the House of Allah, which is a state of Oneness. Then s/he discontinues the call because of having completely vanished within the House: his/her presence melts into the unique oneness of the House, which is the focus of all creation. The black stone is a metaphor of universal relationships. It is a representation of star dust which is the structure of our earth and our bodies. Al-Ihr\u0101m This is considered the first of the four spiritual Pillars of the Pilgrimage. It is the act of entering the process of the Pilgrimage. It is thus called because the person making the pilgrimage abstains from shaving, cutting fingernails, hunting, and having sexual relations. It also refers to the donning of a garment, usually of white cotton, wool or linen, worn during the performance of the Pilgrimage. Its significance is that all things which are permitted (hal\u0101l) are forbidden (har\u0101m), in addition to what is already forbidden, to the person of this station while he is wearing the white garment, out of reverence for the sanctity of Allah. The people of gnosis consider it to mean the exodus from every circumstance, whether it be exalted or lowly or whether it be related to time or space. This is often referred to as \u2018Freedom from Surroundings\u2019. If the person of this station does not exit from the limitations of time and space and from the external world of phenomena he will not arrive at his destination. All human experiences occur within the realm of phenomena. Outside of it there is no time or space, because Allah existed when there was no time and no space, and He remains unchanged. This entire realm of existence, with respect to His Magnitude and Glory, is no more than a mustard seed or smaller. Taw\u0101f This is the second of the four spiritual Pillars of Pilgrimage. The word in this context signifies the return to the Manifestation of the Essence which is worthy of Divinity ( ul\u016bhiyah ), and which is described in terms related to meaning and spirituality, travelling through the realm of meaning, and the various qualities of the manifestations of the Creator and the creation. The taw\u0101f is also a journey of reflection into the inter-relatedness of the seven key Attributes (Living, Knowing, Willing, Able, Communicating, Seeing, Hearing), the characteristics of their composition, and the dependence of one upon the other. When the pilgrim enters the Sanctuary he finds the six directions (i.e. north, south, east, west, above and below) all facing towards the Ka`bah. If it is like this for the seeker, how is it for the Master who has vanished within the Essence of his Creator and who represents Allah in his words? Everything which issues forth from the tongues of the Masters comes from the beams issuing forth from the Presence of the Unique Oneness. Sa`y This is the third of the four spiritual pillars of the pilgrimage. Hastening between the stations of the Pilgrimage, which are called Saf\u0101 and Marwa , refers to the fluctuation of the Master between Allah\u2019s Beauty ( jam\u0101l ) and His Glory and Majesty ( jal\u0101l ) to the point where Glory becomes the essence of Beauty because of his having abandoned his self, not to mention his own will and freedom of choice. This fluctuation between Beauty and Majesty represents the Masters\u2019 rank of perfection. Their movement represents the Hand of Allah\u2019s concern and His protection in both states. In spite of the lofty position of the Masters, they are not seduced by what they have already attained from the taw\u0101f and their immersion in the Presence of Oneness. Majesty and Beauty do not affect them because they are part of them, in contrast to others for whom this state would represent a tribulation. He who is with Allah loves Allah\u2019s constriction as well as His expansion, and sees both of them as being natural occurrences like night and day, as they are both necessary conditions of experiencing being-ness. Constriction is an attribute of the physical while expansion is an attribute of the spiritual. The Master lets the station seek him out and does not try to seek it out. The station was created for him he was not created for the station. He is concerned exclusively with the glorification of Allah and allows everything else to serve him in his dedication. Wuq\u016bf This is the stopping place or Pause of the Pilgrimage on the plains of \u2018Arafat. As the Prophet said: \"The Pilgrimage is `Arafah.\" After completing Taw\u0101f and Sa`y , the Master is overcome by a state above which there is no higher condition or increase, which is the abandonment of anything known to him beyond the ability to describe. In this station of absolute abandonment, he is ordered to give up his physical form, his soul, his self, his reasoning, the names as well as the Attributes, and anything which has the scent of manifestation; he is commanded to gatheredness and to enfold the outward within the inward and the inward in the outward. When he has realized this state then he has completed the climb up the mountain, which is referred to as the Pause. It is also referred to as \u2018The Blindness\u2019 because it is absolute non\u2011existence, witnessing neither creation nor Creator. The Pause is a station beyond reasoning, and therefore impossible to express, that it has been called the \u2018obscure\u2019, the \u2018amazement\u2019, the \u2018bewilderment\u2019, the \u2018obliteration\u2019, and the \u2018Realm of L\u0101h\u016bt \u2019 (Pure Unity). People of Allah are in wonderment at the mention of it, unable to describe it as if they were deaf and dumb and powerless to reason. `Arafah, then, is the station of the Pause and the final goal of total annihilation (or complete vanishing from existence). The Pause occurs after zuhr (midday prayer time) and after the vanishing of existence ( zaww\u0101l ): \"When the sun is rolled up and the stars are cast adrift.\" Qur'an, 81:1\u20112 This is the station of obliteration and blindness, of which the Prophet said: \"Indeed, it is the station of blindness (with) no atmosphere above it or below it.\" As this station is incomprehensible and full of awe one must exit from it as soon as possible, remaining merely for a pause. The seeker must then hasten to the place of nearness: Muzdalifah . \"Flee from it (`Arafah) to the Place of Nearness (Muzdalifah) lest you vanish within it.\" Thus, it is cried out in bewilderment: \"O my Lord, from the standpoint of the Truth of Existence, You are the Worshipper and You are the Worshipped, You are the Witness and the Witnessed.\" After this, the seeker must hasten to Makkah, which is referred to as the Presence of Oneness, in order to cease his wandering, attain a sense of security, bathe, and pray his sunrise prayer. This concludes all four spiritual Pillars of the Pilgrimage. A\u1e63-\u1e63af\u0101 and Al-marwah Throughout your life you run back and forth between two opposite things, like a\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101 and al-Marwah . A\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101 and al-Marwah are two clusters of rocks between which the pilgrim runs back and forth. They are the scene of Hajar\u2019s running to and fro in search of water, after being left alone with \u2018Ismail in the blistering heat and wilderness of Mecca. They figuratively bracket all human efforts, from hunger to fullness, from illness to wellness, and man\u2019s patience and tawakkul (trust, confidence) in Allah are tested through running between them. A\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101 and al-Marwah , and the practice of sa\u2019y (running between the two of them), are indeed true signs of Allah. Man performs sa\u2019y throughout his life in his constant search for true contentment, seeking it outwardly, not knowing that the access to it is already within him.","title":"Journey Words"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#journey-words","text":"","title":"Journey Words"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#sair","text":"The most direct translation of this word is \"travel\".

In the Shadhili tariqa , the masters never slept in one place for more than three weeks, so as not to take what was around them for granted. Haraka ma\u2019a-l-baraka : movement is with blessing. Man must change, he must move on so that he does not become a slave of outer habits and become fixated. Man is attracted to fixation because he loves the permanent, the ever-fixed within him. But to desire preservation of outer fixation is ignorance. The outer can never be fixed. No sooner does man try to control an event than he finds it beyond his power to do so. Man wants to know the permanent but he mistakenly tries to bring it about in his environment by establishing rigid habits. At the lowest, most superficial level, travel disturbs this tendency. The earth would be sterile if it were not disturbed, if it were not plowed. The same thing applies to man\u2019s heart. If it is not disturbed, if it is not cut off from its desires and attachments, how can it resonate and keep turning? At first one resents being cut off, but the purpose of one\u2019s life is to move both outwardly and inwardly; outwardly by having dynamic attitudes toward the world and the earth, and inwardly by being willing to turn away from what the self desires.","title":"Sa\u2019ir"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#hajj","text":"The word hajj literally means \"endeavor, aspiration, intention, destination, object, goal, aim\".

For this reason there are few who speak of it. In The Lantern of the Path , Imam Ja`far al\u2011Sadiq said: \"If you want to make the Pilgrimage then empty your heart before your departure of every distraction and concealing veil and turn all your affairs over to your Creator and trust in Him\u2026\" \"\u2026then wash your sins away with the water of sincere repentance and don the garments of truth, purity and humility.\"","title":"Hajj"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#umrah","text":"This is the voluntary visit to the Ka`bah at other times of the year. The word `umrah is from the Arabic three letter root `AMR, which means to construct, build and inhabit, implying \u2018flourishing, inhabiting, giving life to, populating, and building\u2019. Thus, `umrah means to cause to flourish and to be enlivened by one\u2019s presence at the Ka`bah. The Ka`bah is a metaphor for divine impenetrability and for this reason there is no fear for the one who is present there. It is the Fortress of Eternal Truth \u2013 everlasting and perfect. Whoever performs the `Umrah is not obliged to perform the Pause at `Arafah, but only the Taw\u0101f and the Hastening Between Stations, and does not leave Makkah before visiting the House many times. This represents the passion for Allah\u2019s Names and Attributes which encompass the universe and the Ka`bah is its centre. Going to Madinah and to the Presence of Muhammad is not considered complementary to the House of Allah, because the prophetic presence is a manifestation of the Presence of Oneness. The enlightened seeker sees through the Muhammadi Presence, and his spiritual insight witnesses the Presence of Oneness \u2013 the Unique Absolute One. As his outer is within the shari`ah, his soul is within the tariqah and his Innermost is within the haqiqah. Reflecting upon \u2018Muhammad the Messenger of Allah \u2019 will reveal that \u2018Muhammad\u2019 represents the Physical Universe and the \u2018Messenger\u2019 (ras\u016bl) represents the Spiritual Realms, and that \u2018Allah\u2019 represents the Realm of Power.

Fa\u1e6dara also means \"to create\". Non-creation cracked and split open to reveal its opposite, creation. Basic knowledge is Fi\u1e6dr\u012b, connected with the pre-creational crack. Access to Basic knowledge is through diving deep into the well to reach the source of the spring where the original crack is. The Saf\u012bh, the foolish, ignorant one whose life is cluttered and whose well is filled up with the debris of illusions, desires, attachments and covetousness, has no access to that original crack, that fi\u1e6drah. R\u016b\u1e25 R\u016b\u1e25 means \u201cspirit, soul.\u201d It is related to r\u012b\u1e25 , which means \u201cwind.\u201d R\u0101\u1e25ah , which means \u201ccomfort, contentment, or ease,\u201d also comes from the same root, as does the word r\u0101\u2019i\u1e25ah , which means \u201cperfume\u201d and mirwa\u1e25ah , which means \u201cfan.\u201d The implication here is that the spirit is like a wind; it is as subtle as a summer breeze. The spirit is blown into the body and later blown out of it. Like the wind, its subtlety is balanced by its forcefulness. It says in the Qur\u2019an: \u201cThey ask you about the soul. Say: the soul is one of the commands of my Lord\u201d (17:85). On that Night of Power the All-Mighty, All-Powerful Lord extends His mercy of knowledge and opens up the skies, and the angelic powers and forces fulfill their merciful duty of bringing forth clearly the message and knowledge of taw\u1e25\u012bd and the command and control of the Lord. Sajdah Closeness to Allah is by sajdah, by prostration, which is the outer proof of inner abandonment. Outer prostration is the manifestation of an inner state; if it is not, it becomes an empty ritual. Sajada, the root of sajdah, also means \u201cto obey,\u201d meaning to obey the purpose of existence. The purpose of existence is merciful and benign. Another meaning of sajada is \u201cto submit,\u201d and through that submission comes freedom. The only freedom is the recognition of no freedom. The only freedom is the direct inner recognition that there is absolutely no possibility of freedom. From that comes the ultimate freedom and release which is the real and infinite freedom, freedom that is beyond our creation and after our end. Our purpose is to be in that state of inward drunkenness and outward sobriety, inward abandonment and outward courtesy and correctness. In this state we become awareness itself, not aware of something. This then is the outer manifestation of sajdah, of prostration, which is spontaneous. It is the only human position and it is the final as well as the first human position. Fajr Fajr means \u201cdawn, the first light of the morning.\u201d Fajara, the root of fajr, means \u201cto crack, to break out, to explode.\u201d The state of the heart of the knower is hidden in the darkness of the night but is illumined inwardly. It is outwardly in darkness yet bright with inner light, outwardly quiet but inwardly active and dynamic in the sea of knowledge. Most spiritual work is done from late at night until the dawn, when outwardly there is the least physical action and therefore a maximum possibility for inner action. The root of everything lies in its opposite. The root of the most beautiful, soft, white, ravishing lily lies in mud just as the root of maximal inner action lies in outer quietude. From the knowledge that all creation exists according to a measure and is moving toward a destiny according to that measure, comes the peace of certainty. This inner certainty, which illumines all possible outer manifestations, brings about an equilibrium and balance that renders the awakened being in a state full of harmony and unity. The meaning of that peace, which is the result of knowledge, resides inherently in every heart. For the seed to be unearthed, the heart must be purified and made open. The seeker of the knowledge of Allah spends his days of darkness and nights of vigil awaiting the descent of the opening, and when that occurs it is like the crack of dawn. Dhikr The Arabic word for remembrance is dhikr . Remembrance is of several types or levels. There is the remembrance of physical things, which are in front of us, and there is the remembrance of one\u2019s desires, anxieties, and so on. Along the spiritual path, remembrance relates to that which is in one\u2019s innate nature. It is the remembrance of the Essence of Allah the Almighty, of the Source of all manifestations and attributes. That source is within everybody. On the Sufi path, one is required to dis-remember everything else that is discernible, everything that is other than Allah, in order to return to the original remembrance. The Arabic word for remembrance of Allah is dhikru\u2019llah. So the original remembrance of Allah is already in every heart, whether one is aware of it or not. Through the guidance of a spiritual master, the seeker is led beyond, to a level where there is no remembrance of anything that is mentionable. Then that which has always been there, encompassing everything, is eventually experienced and witnessed. The purpose of Sufi practices is to be spontaneously aware of the absolute or central reality as well as remaining aware of the physical and material limitations of the phenomenal world which surrounds us. One is an inner awareness beyond the senses and the other is an outer awareness which is based on senses. Qadr and Qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 \"Certainly, We sent it down on the Night of the Decree.\" The Power that created all the creational systems made them according to a measure, the Decree or qadr , by which all creational manifestations are brought to their destiny, qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 , and final judgment. In the above ayat we are given a glimpse into an aspect of the meaning of qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 wa qadr (destiny and decree). Qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 means \u201cfate, destiny, judgment, justice, decree,\u201d and \u201cthat which has passed,\u201d and while qadr means \u201cmeasure, decree,\u201d it also means \u201cdestiny\u201d because it is according to a measure that things unfold and develop. The judgment, or the final destiny, of any created thing follows according to its measure, its qadr , for if it did not, there would be chaos. These measures may fluctuate and interweave within definite bounds, but there must be a measure in order for man to know the limits and to gain knowledge of the world. Laylat al-qadr is the Night of Power, or the Night of the Decree. The knowledge of what is written descended on the night of power and was made known to the Prophet Muhammad, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa salaam . Thus it is the night when he was empowered with knowledge, the night when the hidden tablet was unveiled to him. The night of qadr occurs according to each person\u2019s capacity. \u201cThe Night of the Decree\u201d is that night of revelation when the heart opens, when the tablet within man\u2019s heart is unveiled, when the direct recognition that there is only Allah, and that everything which comes into creation comes through that single power, is experienced. This tablet does not contain encyclopedic information: it contains direct knowledge. Eid The word Eid appears only once in the Qur\u2019an, in Surah Ma\u00b4idah . It is the story of the sincere followers of the Prophet Isa. They ask him: \"Can\u2019t you bring upon us from the unseen a banquet or a meal, or some nourishment? We want to taste of it so that our hearts become completely certain that all of it is from Allah.\" So Isa asks his Lord to bring down a heavenly banquet \u2013 an Eid , not only for those who came first but also for those of later time. We always quest the proof of the connection between the seen and the unseen, as our soul is heavenly but living on earth. This is the meaning of Eid . The Arabic root is aada , \u2018to have returned\u2019. Return to what? All of us, who have fasted, tend to return once more towards over indulgence. This is not an interesting return. What is worthwhile to return to is the original condition of Adam in the Garden. We need to move towards that Eid . \u1e62adr \u1e62adr (plural \u1e63ud\u016br) is the chest or breast, that part of one which faces what confronts one. It is where the battles and dramas take place. It must be remembered that every drama is self-created. Every imaginable human role stirs in the breast of man: the king, the despot, the afflicted, the jealous, the strong, the doubter, and the complainer. We have to take refuge from these, take refuge in the Lord Whose mercy brings us to the recognition that everything which occurs, visible and invisible, occurs according to a just system, according to perfect laws which govern this passage, this journey through the creation.","title":"Key Words"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#key-words","text":"","title":"Key Words"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#fitrah","text":"Fi\u1e6drah is the \"natural and basic disposition\" of humankind and is derived from fa\u1e6dara, to split or break apart, hence If\u1e6d\u0101r, \"breaking of the fast\".

It is the only human position and it is the final as well as the first human position.","title":"Sajdah"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#fajr","text":"Fajr means \u201cdawn, the first light of the morning.\u201d Fajara, the root of fajr, means \u201cto crack, to break out, to explode.\u201d The state of the heart of the knower is hidden in the darkness of the night but is illumined inwardly. It is outwardly in darkness yet bright with inner light, outwardly quiet but inwardly active and dynamic in the sea of knowledge. Most spiritual work is done from late at night until the dawn, when outwardly there is the least physical action and therefore a maximum possibility for inner action. The root of everything lies in its opposite. The root of the most beautiful, soft, white, ravishing lily lies in mud just as the root of maximal inner action lies in outer quietude. From the knowledge that all creation exists according to a measure and is moving toward a destiny according to that measure, comes the peace of certainty. This inner certainty, which illumines all possible outer manifestations, brings about an equilibrium and balance that renders the awakened being in a state full of harmony and unity. The meaning of that peace, which is the result of knowledge, resides inherently in every heart. For the seed to be unearthed, the heart must be purified and made open. The seeker of the knowledge of Allah spends his days of darkness and nights of vigil awaiting the descent of the opening, and when that occurs it is like the crack of dawn.","title":"Fajr"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#dhikr","text":"The Arabic word for remembrance is dhikr . Remembrance is of several types or levels. There is the remembrance of physical things, which are in front of us, and there is the remembrance of one\u2019s desires, anxieties, and so on. Along the spiritual path, remembrance relates to that which is in one\u2019s innate nature. It is the remembrance of the Essence of Allah the Almighty, of the Source of all manifestations and attributes. That source is within everybody. On the Sufi path, one is required to dis-remember everything else that is discernible, everything that is other than Allah, in order to return to the original remembrance. The Arabic word for remembrance of Allah is dhikru\u2019llah. So the original remembrance of Allah is already in every heart, whether one is aware of it or not. Through the guidance of a spiritual master, the seeker is led beyond, to a level where there is no remembrance of anything that is mentionable. Then that which has always been there, encompassing everything, is eventually experienced and witnessed. The purpose of Sufi practices is to be spontaneously aware of the absolute or central reality as well as remaining aware of the physical and material limitations of the phenomenal world which surrounds us. One is an inner awareness beyond the senses and the other is an outer awareness which is based on senses.","title":"Dhikr"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#qadr-and-qada","text":"\"Certainly, We sent it down on the Night of the Decree.\" The Power that created all the creational systems made them according to a measure, the Decree or qadr , by which all creational manifestations are brought to their destiny, qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 , and final judgment. In the above ayat we are given a glimpse into an aspect of the meaning of qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 wa qadr (destiny and decree). Qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 means \u201cfate, destiny, judgment, justice, decree,\u201d and \u201cthat which has passed,\u201d and while qadr means \u201cmeasure, decree,\u201d it also means \u201cdestiny\u201d because it is according to a measure that things unfold and develop. The judgment, or the final destiny, of any created thing follows according to its measure, its qadr , for if it did not, there would be chaos. These measures may fluctuate and interweave within definite bounds, but there must be a measure in order for man to know the limits and to gain knowledge of the world. Laylat al-qadr is the Night of Power, or the Night of the Decree. The knowledge of what is written descended on the night of power and was made known to the Prophet Muhammad, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa salaam . Thus it is the night when he was empowered with knowledge, the night when the hidden tablet was unveiled to him. The night of qadr occurs according to each person\u2019s capacity. \u201cThe Night of the Decree\u201d is that night of revelation when the heart opens, when the tablet within man\u2019s heart is unveiled, when the direct recognition that there is only Allah, and that everything which comes into creation comes through that single power, is experienced.

No-one can tell you who you are. It is important that you read the article Less is More and reflect fully on it before you go through these guides. Note 2 : This article is an extract from the book \"Journey of the Self\" . If it piques your interest, you should buy the book, as these particular maps of the self and its journeys falls into the 4 th of 5 stages of development in both microcosm (human self) and macrocosm (the cosmos). These stages are: Absolute Unitive Reality, Inner Dependence, Outer Dependence, Interdependence, and Inner Reliance. The guide provided below is but a small part of a larger story, as is always the case. The Seven Kinds of Self The models below are only meant as examples to guide. The stages within a given model naturally overlap, and the entire spectrum within the model remains active to varying degrees of intensity within the human throughout one's life. In the first model, for example, the saint is not exempt from recognising a glimpse of the commanding self within. 1 - The Commanding Self The first and lowest station is that of the commanding self ( al-nafs al-ammara ). This is the station of one who is not sufficiently developed inwardly, who is crude and childish, base, egoistic and selfish, with little concern or connection with other than self-gratification. This is the self that is dominated by the physical body, and follows mainly the gratification of sensual pleasure and fleeting desires. This state draws the heart towards its lower and negative extreme. This facet of the self is the abode of most vices and the source of all bad characters. The characteristics of the commanding self encompass meanness, greed, envy, jealousy, ignorance, self-importance, pride, glory, presumption, arrogance, sensuality, anger, violence, insensitivity, lack of insight, and vile manners, interference in what does not concern one, making fun and mocking others, avarice, hatred, qualities of rigidity and dogma, opacity, and the inability to be reached or to form stable relationships. The colour related to the commanding self is blue. It is the blue of intense heat in the middle of the flame. 2 - The Reproachful Self The second station is the reproachful self ( al-nafs al-lawwama ). In this station, the self develops some sense of right and wrong. It begins to have glimpses into its own conduct and occasionally even blames itself for wrong behaviour. The reproachful self does have some measure of awareness and discrimination, but that reproach usually occurs after the event. It is like a crack, so to speak, in the solid frame of the commanding self, that gives rise to the reproachful self with a slight degree of flexibility and awareness. Its characteristics are acting upon whims of the moment, conceit, having to do with self-image, vanity, injustice, bias, backbiting, slander, lying, and excessive love of leadership. Its colour is yellow. This colour is located on the edge of the flame and represents descending and decaying energy. 3 - The Inspired Self The third station is the inspired self ( al-nafs al-mulhamma ). This condition of the self is supple and dynamic, and therefore leads to vulnerability. It is an interspace between good and bad. The keeping of good company and right guidance is necessary at this stage for the self to evolve. This is also the station of love, and of being in love. We generally find this type of self attractive because it reminds us of a free spirit, as it is less attached and more willing to change course, and is freer of inhibition and attachments. The inspired self is considered easy to treat, for it is not tethered. It has no firm anchorage or rigid boundaries. It is inspired and mobile like quicksilver. One may think of it as mercury - flexible and mobile, but elusive and difficult to steady and grasp. This type of self may begin to be developed and groomed once it has been contained, stabilised and nurtured within a stable base. In this state is the danger of excessive love and wonderment of nature, even worship. This state can be found in scientists, painters, musicians and artists, because of the preponderance of wonderment and marvels that are experienced in their areas. The characteristics of the inspired self are generosity, forgiveness, tolerance, endurance, good opinion, acknolwedging faults, an open-faced smiling countenance, love of peace and meditation, contentment with the decree, and having the ability to weep easily, which is the opposite of the commanding self. Its colour is read, which is lively and vivid and at the centre of the flame. 4 - The Certain Self The fourth station is the certain self ( al-nafs al-mutma'ina ). Here, the self attains confidence and security by knowledge and experience. The self can journey back to its origins, to recall and become inwardly awakened to the reality that everything, including itself, is from reality and to that reality is its return, by the grace and mercy of the same reality. It is that self whose light has been ignited by the spark of the heart, and has overcome the lower characteristics and taken on the higher qualities. It is content, not out of ignorance, but with knowledge. Its contentment is a result of the knowledge that it has done its best within its limits, and therefore all is well. The heart is clear and it is tranquil, content, and steady with faith and trust. Amongst the characteristics of the certain self are unsolicited generosity, dependence on the Creator, freedom from fear of need or attachment, spontaneous awareness of the rule of opposites in the world, sincerity, contentment, freedom in action, contentment with the decree, absence of agitation, gratitude for the perfection of creation and one's place in it, fear and dread of trespassing the bounds (for fear at the beginning of the path is knowledge, fear in the middle is ignorance, fear at the end is delight), being on a clear path, acting only out of certainity, a heart full of trust, faith, certainity, knowledge, right action and security. Its colour is white, reflecting all the colours (and holding or absorbing none). 5 - The Contented Self The fifth station is the contented self ( al-nafs al-radhiya ). It is the station of the one who sees the truth always, in every situation and everything. Its characteristics are sincerity, innocent genuineness, continuing caution and fear of trespassing the bounds, scrupulousness, total inner courtesy, and avoiding any desire except that of knowledge and the pleasure of reality. The contented self is childlike in its simplicity. It is spontaneous, always living in the moment. Its colour is green, the colour of growth and life on earth - the pleasant and \"middle\" colour. 6 - The Self That Everything Is Contented With The sixth station is the self that pleases and satisfies the rest of creation ( al-nafs al-mardhiya ). If one is knowingly content with one's Creator, then everything in creation is content and in harmony with oneself. This is the station where the world of the macrocosm is in equilibrium with the microcosm. This self overflows with mercy and love towards all creation, is devoted to the service of others, and is in complete balance in that interspace between the outer world and the inner reality. This self's responsibilities in the outer world do not veil it from the joy and bliss of inner realities, nor do the inner delights blind it from outer obligations. Here, the self does not know anger, greed, revenge or hatred. Its colour is black, which absorbs all the other colours. All shades and colours stop here. 7 - The Perfected Self The ultimate station is the perfected self ( al-nafs al-kamila ), or the station of pure beingness. Of this station, the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: \"He who knows himself knows his Lord.\" He is the one who knows himself to be an interspace, combined of a physical vehicle (or body), and a spirit of divine origin that rides upon the vehicle as a means of witnessing and arriving back to its blissful abode - the eternal Garden. It also means that he is where the beautiful names of God (the divine attributes of Reality) are gathered and known. The perfected self is in the state of unific knowledge, oneness in divine unity, the state of pure consciousness and pure beingness. The Four Journeys Another model of the journey of the self is given by the great Sufi master, Mulla Sadra. He uses the analogy of the wayfarer to describe any human's journey from the state of ignorant darkness to one of illuminated awareness. In this model he describes the four stages of unveilings along the journey. It begins when a human reaches a point where s/he realises there is no lasting fulfillment in the existential, changing world. We all experience at different times in our life the desire for tranquility and seclusion. When worldly difficulties and failures mount, we may wish to leave it all. Many of us go through a period when the monastic life seems an appropriate refuge and it is during these times that we want to turn our backs on creation. It is often at times of the greatest difficulty and confusion that we turn towards the path of discovery of the source in order to understand the position we have landed in. It is when the actors in the play begin to question the plot that we seek to know the author and ask for an explanation. When we reach this point and realise that there can be no lasting fulfillment in the existential, changing world, we take flight to the edge of the known, which is the unknown dimension. Here the first stage of unveiling begins. The four stages which follow illustrate the main stations that the successful wayfarer attains in his/her journey. Throughout life, s/he will continue to experience the entire spectrum of states to varying degress of intensity. What Mulla Sadra wishes to emphasise here is the established station that the wayfarer attains, rather than simply the passing, temporary state which s/he will continue to experience from time to time in life. The First Journey: From Creation to Creator The first barrier to cross, or the first unveiling, is from the creation to the Creator. The wayfarer flees from the confusing, physical and material universe of opposites to another dimension - the dependable, real and reassuring world of the unified field of reality. The silence within is the knock on the inner door. The unveiling of the first barrier involves tearing away veils both of darkness and light that exist between the seeker and the spiritual reality within. Then the ascent can begin from the station of the lower self to the station of the intellect, and from the station of the intellect to the the station of the spirit, and from the station of the spirit to the farthest goal of supreme splendour. If the wayfarer succeeds in reaching this goal, the final veils are lifted and s/he is annihilated by the death of the transitory, dissolved and submerged in the divine source. The Second Journey: With the Creator by the Courtesy of the Creator The second unveiling is the journey across the barrier to knowledge of the Creator. The wayfarer is now exposed to Reality by the courtesy of Reality. S/he moves totally in the inner realm. S/he attains gnosis. His/her essence, attributes and actions become annihilated in the divine essence. In this journey, s/he sees through His seeing, hears through His hearing and knows through His knowing. When the inner journey and discoveries are taking place, the wayfarer looks for greater confirmation of these openings. S/he is like someone who discovers that s/he is truly a guest, and that the Host is most generous and understanding. The wayfarer then hopes for this condition to last and to remain in this refuge. As though s/he sees his/her image in a mirror for the first time. s/he seeks confirmation and establishment of what s/he has seen. The Third Journey: From the Creator to Creation by the Permission of the Creator The completion of the second unveiling marks the start of the third journey. In this, the wayfarer returns from the Creator back to creation by the permission of the Creator. In this journey, s/he is armed with the knowledge of truth. The wayfarer's state of self-annihilation is complete and s/he now attaines full sobriety and balance. S/he subsists through the subsistence of the Creator. S/he returns to creation by the authority of the Creator with the knowledge of the unveiling. The nature of life does not change and it carries on with its ups and downs. There is no avoidance by anyone of experiencing these outer waves which occur at the surface above the still depths of the ocean. So when the wayfarer is established in his station, s/he returns to creation with all its turmoil. However, the wayfarer, because of his/her knowledge of the nature of the ocean, is now far more able to deal with its changing surface. The waves are of little signficance and the storms are relative puffs of wind compared to the stable mass of the deep. The Fourth Journey: With Creation by the Authority of the Creator The wayfarer then embarks upon the fourth stage, which is to be among creation by the autority of the Creator, when nothing else remains but service in the bliss of knowledge. the seeker observes and recognises creation and humanity, their behaviour and needs. S/he knows the good that they bring about and the evil that they cause, and what causes them happiness and what brings misery. In all this, s/he is with the truth, for his/her entire being has been submerged in reality, and the service rendered by him/her to other beings does not distract from the inner divine bliss, steadfastness and certainty. The fully realised being is now in the ultimate unitive state. S/he is completely in outer service of humanity and in inner abandonment, freedom and joy. When reality in all its various aspects is unveiled to the wayfarer and s/he is established in the knowledge of truth within, a new outlook towards creation emerges. The awakened being sees the divine thread through all existence and therefore is qualified to serve with selflessness, with no danger to creation or to themself. When the individual self has aligned itself with original unified reality, the flowering of the spiritual being has occurred. It is this unveiling that is referred to as \"with creation by the authority of the Creator.\" Wherever the enlightened being looks, he sees the trace and the mark of the Creator. S/he is now an agent of transformation, a loyal slave to the Divine Master and a freed being with no choice but to reflect what comes to his/her pure heart. This is the state of a prophet with the people - outwardly the same as any of them, inwardly turned to the eternal origin.","title":"The Self and its Journeys"},{"location":"guides/7-stations-4-journeys/#the-7-stations-of-self-and-the-4-journeys","text":"Note 1 : The map is not the territory, and these overviews are provided for committed seekers who have already walked at least some way along the path.

Human interest in fasting is deeply rooted in our consciousness. Fasting has long been resorted to for maintaining physical and mental health as much as for cultural or political reasons. More specifically, fasting has been a devotional practice in most religious and spiritual movements throughout the ages. Islam has prescribed the practice of abstinence and fasting as a means of self-purification and worship. The act of restraining the self from fulfilling its desires purifies and enhances awareness at physical, mental and spiritual levels and sensitizes human consciousness. The seeker realizes the weakness of the self and is gratified by the discipline, restriction and prohibitions, for these limitations are windows to Allah\u2019s limitlessness. Fasting in History In many cultures, such as the Indians of North America, tribes of Brazil, the people of the Pacific Islands and numerous Asian, African and European peoples, fasting has been used as a rite of initiation, marking puberty, prior to hunting and as part of the rites of marriage. In some cultures such as those in the Andaman Islands, Fiji, Samoa, China, Korea and others fasting is observed as a rite of mourning. In general, we find whenever human beings are in need, suppressed, or in fear, they seek God or higher powers through abstinence or penance. When our limited state of knowledge and consciousness is insufficient fasting guides us out of difficulties to find other means of inspiration and solutions. Ancient Egyptians, Greek, Roman, and Chinese cultures practiced fasting to cure various illnesses. The Egyptians believed that fasting three days a month helped to preserve good mental and physical health. The Greeks learned the virtues of fasting from the Egyptians and fasted before battle and the Romans followed suit. Socrates and Plato are known to have regularly performed fasts of ten days duration. Today in the West, fasting is used by alternative and naturopathic systems of medicine and healing for curing a host of acute and chronic diseases and as a useful catalyst in helping the body mobilize its own natural immune system. The Old Testament often refers to fasting: David chastened his soul with fasting, while Moses fasted for forty days when he ascended the mount to receive the tablets of the covenant. Daniel fasted for three weeks, supplicating and praying all the while. Jews observe six obligatory fasts during the year, one such being Yom Kippur. The institution of fasting and abstinence from certain foods in Christianity has its origin in the New Testament as it relates to the fasting of Jesus\u2019 disciples for several days during Lent, the forty-day period before Easter. The duration of the fast during Lent varied throughout the ages, until forty days accompanied by strict rules became the norm. Additional fasts were introduced later in different parts of the Church, such as the fast of Rogation Days, the Ember Weeks, the Whitsun Week, and fasts were also ordained by the Roman Catholic Church. Considerable variations in the practice of fasting are noticed between the Orthodox Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Reformed Churches of Europe. Over time there has been a gradual mitigation in the frequency and rigor of the fasts and abstinences prescribed by Church laws due to extenuating circumstances such as age, health, poverty, hard or continued labor and changing social conditions. Today few are obliged to fast strictly, while some are excused even from abstinence. Roman Catholic legislation further provides for dispensations to be granted by the Church authorities. The overall result is that the practice of fasting has declined and is almost forgotten as a religious exercise. During the twentieth century fasting has sometimes been used as a tool of political and social protest by individuals as well as groups. During the national struggles for independence from colonial rule, several leaders of the third world in Asia and Africa resorted to fasting to highlight their plight and struggle, often with some success. The Islamic Fast For Muslims fasting, or sawm in Arabic, was commanded in the Qur\u2019an as a major obligatory spiritual discipline for the duration of the month of Ramadan. The Arabic word for fasting is derived from the root, \u2018sama\u2019, meaning to abstain from food, drink, smoking, sensual gratifications, wrong actions, harmful intentions, thoughts, words and deeds. Islamic fasting is obligatory for one month in every lunar year, that is, Ramadan, the ninth month in the Islamic calendar. All healthy adults are expected to adhere to the proper rules of fasting. In addition to this obligatory fast, there are many optional fasts, some of which occur regularly every week or month, and some that are scattered throughout the year. These fasts are Sunnah, or the practice of the Prophet. Fasting is also used as a penance for breaking an oath and as a compensation for some other religious obligation. The fast of Ramadan begins with the physical sighting of the new moon. Throughout the month a Muslim may not eat or drink from daybreak (when a fine strip of light may be seen on the horizon) until the sun has set. Before dawn a small meal ( suhur ) is usually recommended to be taken, although not obligatory, and the fast is broken just before the sunset ( maghrib ) prayer traditionally with dates and water, to be immediately followed by the prayer. Later on a larger meal is partaken by the entire family, often shared with relatives, friends and guests. The daily fast is begun by formulating the intention to perform the fast as a rite by making a clear intention (niyyah) to observe the fast. No one should fast if their health cannot sustain it or if a fast should threaten one\u2019s health. Pregnant and nursing women whose health may be harmed are exempted, as are those who are travelling away from home. When health is restored or other conditions for not fasting are removed (such as menstruation) then the person is expected to make up the fast later during the course of the year. Ramadan offers the believer an opportunity to mark an end to daily indulgences, or at least to impose clear limits on a daily basis for the duration of a month. This daily restraint breaks the habitual patterns of the self and constitutes a purification both of body and spirit, which brings about renewal of strength and greater spiritual awareness. Each and every ritualistic practice of Islam disciplines the individual and strengthens Muslim society if applied thoroughly. Every year the month of Ramadan falls at different times because the lunar calendar is shorter than the solar by approximately ten days. This means that as the period of the fast is brought forward annually, Ramadan will fall during all seasons of the year in a gradual progression. Despite the strict rules and restraint induced by the fast, Ramadan is usually a joyful time for Muslims everywhere. The last ten nights of the month, particularly the odd nights, are the spiritual highlights of Ramadan, for one of these nights is Laylat al-Qadr, the Night of Determination, in which the Qur\u2019an was first revealed to the Prophet. During these nights Muslims spend their nights in supplication and prayer, hoping to favorably influence the course of events that will unfold subsequently. Ramadan comes to a close with the celebrations and prayers of Eid al-Fitr . On this day a Muslim will give appropriate alms to the poor, and families gather for a light morning repast after the congregational prayer. The Eid prayer, usually performed outdoors is accompanied by a discourse delivered by the prayer leader after which people exchange good wishes and celebrate their success in performing a most important act of worship and attaining a heightened awareness and purposefulness in life. The Prophet of Allah said: \"The root of Islam is prayer, its branches are the obligatory tax, its height is the fast, and its expanse is striving in the way of Allah.\" He also said: \"The tax of the body is fasting.\" A Jew who was one of the most learned of his people asked the Messenger of Allah: \"Why did Allah make it obligatory upon your people to fast throughout the day for thirty days?\" The Prophet replied: \"When Adam ate from the tree it remained within his stomach for thirty days, so Allah made it obligatory upon his offspring to experience thirty days of hunger and thirst. Whatever they eat at night is a grace from Allah. Thus it was with Adam, so Allah made the same obligatory for my people.\" Then he recited the verse: \"The fast is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you.\" Qur'an, 2:183 Imam al\u2011Rida wrote the following concerning the obligation to fast: \"It is so that one may know the feeling of hunger and thirst, so that he will be humble and helpless, in order to be an indication of the difficulties of the Hereafter. Within it is contained the breaking of desires so that one will experience the deprivations caused by withholding from the poor and the needy.\" Imam al\u2011Sadiq relates that the Prophet said: \"The fast is a shield, that is, a veil protecting one from the afflictions of the world and from the punishment of the Hereafter. Thus, when you fast, make the intention to restrain your self from its desires and cut off the thoughts inspired by Shaytan. Bring yourself to the place where you are content without the desire for food or drink.\" The purpose of the fast is to deaden the desires of the self; it is a cleansing for the heart and the body and a revival of both the inner and the outer. It also includes given by those who stand in need before Allah gratitude for the grace and goodness bestowed. It increases humility, meekness, and tears, and causes one to seek refuge with Allah. The reason food is permitted during the night is because Allah does not make one responsible for more than one can endure. Allah has made it easy for us, which is the main characteristic of the shari`ah . Previously it has been said that Adam performed his fast in the daytime, that his repentance ( tawbah ) was accepted at the time of the afternoon prayer, and that he was freed of transgression at the time of the sunset prayer. This tradition is observed every day during one month so that during this time one may rid oneself of wrong actions and then be joyous in one\u2019s liberation from them by eating after sunset. The degrees of fasting can be arranged in the following manner: The first and lowest of them is that the person fasting limits himself to refraining from those things which would render his fast null and void but not from doing those things which are considered reprehensible. This is the fast of the general masses. The second is to restrain the body from whatever is considered reprehensible. Consequently, one guards his tongue against slander, his eyes against desire, and so on with the rest of his body. This represents the fast of the people of tariqah . The third, in addition to the above, is to protect the heart from going astray and from the whisperings of Shaytan, limiting it to the Remembrance of Allah and the witnessing of Him in all His manifestations. This represents the fast of the Chosen Few and is perfection itself. Meaning and Benefits of Fasting The fast is to refrain from specific things during certain specified intervals of time. Among its stipulations is the soundness of the intention covering a specific time period, for example, the month of Ramadan, or for the purpose of fulfilling an oath ( nadhar ). The intention which specifies the type of fast must also be made at the time when it is begun. There are various categories of fasts and each has its particular regulations: obligatory fasts, recommended fasts, fasts for specific oaths, and fasts for non\u2011specific oaths. Those actions which require a fast to be made up ( qada\u2019 ) or expiated ( kaff\u0101rah ) are nine in number and are as follows (as per the teachings of Ahl ul-Bayt): Eating. Drinking. Sexual intercourse. Intentional ejaculation. Intentionally telling a lie concerning Allah, His Messenger, or the Imams. Complete submersion in water. Intentionally taking in thick dust in the throat (e.g. flour or anything similar). Intentionally remaining in a state of jan\u0101bah (ritual impurity) until after fajr. Going back to sleep after having already awakened before fajr. The kaff\u0101rah or expiation consists of fasting for two consecutive months, or feeding sixty people in need, or freeing a slave (this ruling remains even though slavery is no longer practiced, while the more likely practice will be the two former). One may choose one of the above. There are eight actions which will break the fast and will require the Muslim to make up a fast without expiation: Eating, drinking, or engaging in sexual intercourse before confirming whether or not it is actually sunrise. Not accepting it when someone (reliable) says that it is sunrise. Following someone else who says that it is not yet sunrise when one is able to observe it oneself that it is indeed already sunrise. Following someone else who says it is night when one is able to ascertain it oneself. Breaking the fast (ift\u0101r) before its time has arrived; e.g. when in the presence of some obstruction (such as clouds) in the sky which makes it appear to be dark, and then it becomes clear that it is not yet the time of ift\u0101r. Returning to sleep after having already awakened once before taking a ritual bath from jan\u0101bah and not awakening again until after the sun has risen. Water entering the throat for those seeking to cool themselves (but this does not include the rinsing of the mouth in preparation for prayer)8. Finally, taking an enema. For the more mature Muslim, fasting means to abstain from anything which would be displeasing to their Lord and contrary to His commandment and prohibition, either in word or deed. The Messenger of Allah said: \"Everything has a door and the door to acts of devotion is fasting.\" The more advanced seeker abstains from whatever is forbidden and restrains the self. Fasting is a deep link between the seeker and his Lord which no one observes but Allah, in contrast to prayer, the obligatory tax, and the various other actions which are possible for others to notice (and therefore possibly motivated by the desire for acclaim or out of pride). \"Whoever wants to meet his Lord, then let him perform good actions and not see anything other than Allah in the worship of his Lord.\" [18:110] Seeing other than Allah (shirk) in this context refers to performing an act of worship for the eyes of someone other than Allah. The Prophet said: \"The infiltration of shirk within my people is more hidden than the creeping of a black ant on a black stone on a dark night.\" Islamic scholars say that this type of shirk refers to the performance of an act of worship for one\u2019s own reputation of piety or other worldly position. The men of inner knowledge say that it means \u2018to see anything other than the One\u2019, as Imam `Ali has said: \"The lowest form of riy\u0101\u2019 (worship performed to be seen by other than Allah) is shirk.\" There is no question of riy\u0101\u2019 if one sees no one but Allah. Open or hidden shirk will inevitably be weakened by cutting back desires and appetites, as Imam `Ali said: \"Shaytan flows through man like blood so constrict his passageways by hunger.\" The Messenger of Allah said: \"The gates of the garden are opened when Ramadan begins and the gates of the Fire are closed.\" Outward Abstentions 1. Abstention of the Tongue This concerns useless, foolish, or discourteous speech, as well as anything which would be contrary to what pleases Allah. The Prophet said: \"Whoever is silent is saved.\" \"When the discussion reaches Allah, then be silent.\" \"Whoever knows his Lord, his tongue becomes still.\" That is to say, one is incapable of speaking about the absolute Source and Essence. Divine knowledge is to be tasted and witnessed personally and the tongue is incapable of expressing what is beyond the senses and the mind. The Messenger of Allah said: \"Whoever speaks too much speaks frivolously. Whoever speaks frivolously has little modesty. Whoever has little modesty has little restraint, and whoever has little restraint enters the Fire.\" 2. Abstention of the Eyes This involves restraining them from seeing whatever is forbidden according to the shari`ah of Islam. \"Tell the people of faith to avert their eyes and to guard their private parts.\" Qur'an, 24:30 Lowering the gaze is expected from the serious seeker. Desires that arise from seeing can cause distractions that can be subtle and subconscious as well as gross and action-oriented. A blind person may be spared these distractions (unless he or she regains his/her sight). 3. Abstention of the Ears The ears must be restrained from hearing whatever is forbidden in shari`ah, like slander and gossip, music and songs that entice lower tendencies, and listening to the talk of the misguided and the corrupt. 4. Abstention of the Sense of Smell This refers to abstaining from both foul odours as well as exciting scents. Foul odours cause aversion and disgust, whereas sweet scent may excite desires and pleasures. 5. Abstention of the Sense of Taste The meaning here relates to avoidance of whatever may veil the faculty of reason, such as imbibing intoxicating beverages, or by acquiring a taste for usury and unfair profit, abuse of orphans, the poor and the weak, and various other \u2018prohibitive\u2019 tastes and habits which will hinder one\u2019s spiritual progress. \"And do not approach the property of the orphan except in the best manner.\" Qur'an, 6:152 \"But those who take usury will rise up on the Day of Resurrection like someone tormented by Satan\u2019s touch.\" Qur'an, 2:275 6. Abstention of the Sense of Touch This relates to abstaining from touching whatever may lead to forbidden actions, or to excesses in permitted actions, or to go beyond the limits of balance. \"They will say to their skins, \u201cwhy have you testified against us?\u201d They will reply: \u201cAllah has caused us to speak, it is He who gives speech to everything and He created you in the first instance and to Him you will return.\" Qur'an, 41:21 \"Nor were you discreet lest your ears or your eyes or your skins testify against you.\" Qur'an, 41:22 The senses have been created to function in harmony and balance regarding worldly interactions. Anyone who uses the body and its various parts in a manner for which it was not created is considered to be a wrongdoer and out of balance, which is the opposite of harmony, and, therefore, of justice. One explanation of the following verse: \"And the places of prostration (mas\u0101jid) are for Allah, so therefore do not call upon anyone with Allah\" Qur'an, 72:18 is that the human points of prostration include the seven points where the physical body touches the ground. These include the forehead, the two hands, the two knees, and the two feet. These places of prostration are for Allah: they belong to Him and are His slaves, so do not use them in anything which is not pleasing to Him or in anything for which they were not created. Inner abstentions There are five inner abstentions: 1. Worldly Concerns The First Abstention refers to restraining the mind from being occupied with base or worldly concerns. The mind is where reasoning and intellect are developed for interaction with the world. When used properly they lead to rational and good understanding. The Prophet has taught that the contemplation of one hour is better than the actions of seventy years. 2. Useful Knowledge The Second Abstention is to use the mind and intellect to learn about creation and appropriate boundaries and limitations. \"\u2026those who preserve Allah\u2019s limits.\" Qur'an, 9:112 3. The Imagination The Third Abstention involves restraining the imaginal power. In Arabic, this is called the khay\u0101l \u2013 the faculty which enables us to construct entities or ideas which do not physically exist, such as a \u2018flying cat\u2019. During fasts, we must limit its activites to the purpose for which it was created, which is the perception of things in their true higher reality without being overcome by fantasy and foolish imagery. Allah did not create this power for any reason other than to deduce the meaning behind the world of matter. The power of imagination inspired the Pharaoh and his people to imagine that the transformation of the staff of Musa into a serpent was merely a result of magic. 4. Illusions The Fourth Abstention is restraining the power of illusion (and values or meanings given to events or situations) which makes one hate someone one minute and love someone else the next. This wahm prevents one from steadfastness and perseverance on the path of spiritual evolvement. It will cause one to fall prey to the delusion of love and hate and other confusions. Whoever possesses a \"Tranquil Soul\" is free of all of this as he is in the station of witnessing his Beloved and His acts, and \"anything the Beloved does is loved\". Whoever is in this state of witnessing One Reality has no enmity for anyone nor concern. Allah addresses the one who has attained this station: \"O soul that art at rest! Return to your Lord pleased [with Him] and well-pleasing [Him]\". Qur'an, 89:27-28 Whoever truly fasts is the one who possesses a soul that is at rest or tranquil and is not possessed or controlled by his lower self. 5. Combined Senses The Fifth Abstention deals with restraining the combined senses as they manifest themselves, both in subjective thoughts ( wahm ) and in the imagination, and as they constantly appear to the self in both form and meaning. This is naturally an obstacle to progress on the Path, because anyone who is occupied with the senses is veiled from the real significance that lies behind them. Likewise, anyone who is preoccupied with their illusions and self-given values will be veiled from true meaning. The \"One who is veiled, is veiled, regardless of whether it is by one veil or a thousand.\" Consequently, the one who fasts must abstain from the likes of these so that he may be free of all veils and witness his Beloved in the manner we have discussed. There is Only Allah The People of Allah consider the self to be like a tree with ten branches. Each branch naturally takes its share of nutrients which the tree imbibes from the earth. If, however, we suppose that nine of these branches are cut off then the power of those branches and the nutrients which originally went to them would now go to the one remaining branch; it would grow larger and its fruit would be sweeter and bigger. So it is with the self of man. If man ceases to be attached to the world which surrounds him and his attachment is to the trunk then no doubt the fruits of his thought will be loftier, greater, more powerful, and more honorable. The fast of the Gnostic consists of abstaining from witnessing anything other than Allah. Consequently, anyone fasting at this level abstains from anything other than their Beloved, for they assert that there is nothing in existence other than Allah (the Exalted), Allah\u2019s Names, Attributes and Actions; thus, everything relates to Allah, by Allah, and from Allah. This is because anybody who does not restrain his self from witnessing other than Allah is a mushrik, and the fast of the mushrik is not accepted, nor is his prayer, because praying and fasting cleanse the inner from the impurity of seeing another with Allah, and from the illusion of the grossness and the filth of \u2018otherness\u2019 with the water of Unity and the light of faith based on knowledge. It is obvious in prayer and other acts of worship that one cannot cleanse the inner unless the outer is cleansed by way of wudu or ghusl . Likewise, the fast is not valid for the mushrik, whether his shirk be open or concealed, because every mushrik rejects Reality (i.e. a k\u0101fir ) and every k\u0101fir is a mushrik , as Allah has stated: \"And whoever associates (others) with Allah has indeed gone far astray.\" Qur'an, 4:116 The following verse elucidates the meaning of concealed shirk: \"Thus whoever seeks to meet his Lord then let him do good actions and not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord.\" Qur'an, 18:110 If this is an allusion to one who was openly associating others with Allah, Allah would have said: \u2018\u2026and not associate anyone with his Lord.\u2019 But when He says \u2018in the worship of his Lord\u2019 we know that this is an allusion to one who secretly or inadvertently associates others with Allah, who are referred to as being \u2018believers\u2019 and \u2018Muslims\u2019, as Allah has said: \"And most of them do not believe in Allah without associating (others with Him).\" Qur'an, 12:106 And recall what the Prophet said: \"The infiltration of shirk into my people is more hidden than the creeping of a black ant upon a black stone on a dark night.\" The Awakend Seeker The awakened seeker must give up the illusion of seeing actions as coming from other than Allah so that by this realization he may arrive at the station of the Unity of Action. Then he must go past the illusion of seeing Attributes other than those of Allah. That is the station of the Unity of Attributes. Finally, he must go past the veil of \u2018independent\u2019 entities or events \u2013 in Truth, there is no Reality except the One Reality, Allah. That is the station of the Unity of Essence, which is the goal of the Path, and indeed, the goal of existence itself. Shaykh Ahmad al\u2011`Alawi said that whoever has arrived at this station cannot see anything other than Allah even if he intends to do so. He also said that when it is established within one\u2019s self that it is an obligation to abstain from anything other than Allah, the self will begin to long for the knowledge of Allah, and this is like what occurs with the rising of the crescent moon of Ramadan: \"Whoever among you witnesses the month, let him fast\u2026\" Qur'an, 2:185 This station is that of witnessing or seeing, first outwardly and then in the subtle spiritual realms, and whoever does not raise his head will not witness the spiritual realms of the heavens and the earth. The determination and concern of the seeker should not be concentrated in the senses as this will cause the heart to turn away from witnessing the Lord. It is for this reason that he abandons everything which reaches him by way of the senses. The seeker will not be able to concentrate his will and direction until he is detached from his senses. The senses may dominate the outward, as one of the Masters has said that the senses will obliterate meaning unless the senses become the essence of meaning themselves. Shaykh al\u2011`Alawi says that the self of the seeker is afflicted by separation which is often expressed as being in a state of jan\u0101bah ; absorption in Allah, then, is forbidden to him and the veil will descend upon him because of the existence of this obstacle. When the barrier is removed, then the seeker is obliged to make up whatever he missed. Allah has warned those who are not patient with \"one food (Qur'an, 2:61), that is, with the Unity of Essence, and who long for anything other than that from among the realms of creation, when He said: \"Would you exchange that which is good for that which is low and base? Then go down to a city and your wish will be granted\u2026\" Qur'an, 2:61 The significance of \u2018city\u2019 here is that it represents the consuming self with all that it contains of desires and expectations both open and hidden. This is alluded to in: \"\u2026from whatever the earth causes to grow of greens, cucumbers, garlic, lentils and onions.\" Qur'an, 2:61 Here Allah alludes to the desires of the self which lead to degradation: \"\u2026and they were afflicted with degradation and helplessness and were forced to endure anger from Allah.\" Qur'an, 2:61 This is the state when the lower self is in command and the way out is to take strength by way of the friendship of Allah. For this reason it is said that if you want strength which will not vanish, then do not take pride in strength which will vanish. Whoever fasts the fast of haqiqah , and consequently abstains from anything other than Allah, is fasting according to the following hadith qudsi : \"For every good action there is the recompense of ten to seven hundred times its worth except fasting, for, indeed, it is solely for Me and I shall surely be the reward.\" At the earlier phases of spiritual evolvement, the fast is rewarded by the Garden, joy, houris and palaces, or by nearness, attainment, unveiling, and witnessing. At the advanced level the fast has its reward in Allah Himself, the Granter of rewards. The difference between the fast of the people of tariqah and that of the people of haqiqah is that the former is a means for refining the behavior and taking on the Attributes of Allah, as the Prophet said: \"Mould your character with Allah\u2019s Attributes.\" The fast of the people of haqiqah , on the other hand, is a means of attaining annihilation and of cleansing oneself by Allah in the station of Pure Unity, which is referred to as annihilation in Unity; as Allah has said in a hadith qudsi : \"Whoever has sought Me has found Me. Whoever has found Me has come to know Me. Whoever has known Me has loved Me. Whoever has loved Me I have slain. Whomever I have slain the payment of the blood money is on Me, and I will Myself be the payment for the blood money that I owe.\" One relevant example often given is that of a lump of charcoal and fire. Suppose that there is a strong fire which is described in terms of light, burning, and heat, and that next to it lays charcoal which may be described as dark and cold. As this charcoal is gradually moved closer to the fire, we see that it begins to take on the same characteristics as the fire as fire begins to glow from the charcoal itself. Thus, the charcoal becomes fire and no longer remains charcoal. \"These parables We make for the people and they are not understood except by the wise.\" Qur'an, 29:43 The Feast of Fast-Breaking This feast that marks the end of the month of fasting alludes to the breaking of the fast which cannot be realized as long as the seeker\u2019s senses are suppressed, for during the correct fast the senses are made redundant. If the senses return to him from his Lord that is indeed what is sought after; it is this which is referred to as the `Id, \"that which returns (from the word `ada , which means to return). The seeker abandons his senses because he abstains from sensual contact and worldly pleasures. But if the senses actually become conveyors of meaning rather than mere physical experiences, then he no longer needs to abandon them. When this occurs, the senses, the meaning, the uniqueness of Allah and His allegorical similarities become as one: \"\u2026thus wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah.\" Qur'an, 2:115 It is with this same meaning that one Master has said: \"I penetrated the outward and discovered the inward. I examined the inward and found it to be the outward. Thus, there is no inside to the inward and no outside to the outward and I found it to be in accordance with the meaning which is taken from Allah\u2019s words: \u2018He is the First, the Last, the Apparent and the Hidden\u2019 (Qur'an, 57:3).\" We find that most of the great Masters in their later stages appreciate human companionship from which they were alienated earlier on. After spiritual solitude and meditation ( khalwah ), the entire existence for them becomes as if it were solitude in which they see only One Reality, and that is exactly what is sought after from the beginning. If the seeker returns to creation and humankind before being immersed and absorbed in the witnessing of Allah, then he has broken his covenant and his fast is invalid.","title":"Fasting"},{"location":"guides/fasting/#fasting","text":"By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, from the book \" Transformative Worship in Islam \" . Human interest in fasting is deeply rooted in our consciousness. Fasting has long been resorted to for maintaining physical and mental health as much as for cultural or political reasons. More specifically, fasting has been a devotional practice in most religious and spiritual movements throughout the ages. Islam has prescribed the practice of abstinence and fasting as a means of self-purification and worship. The act of restraining the self from fulfilling its desires purifies and enhances awareness at physical, mental and spiritual levels and sensitizes human consciousness. The seeker realizes the weakness of the self and is gratified by the discipline, restriction and prohibitions, for these limitations are windows to Allah\u2019s limitlessness.","title":"Fasting"},{"location":"guides/fasting/#fasting-in-history","text":"In many cultures, such as the Indians of North America, tribes of Brazil, the people of the Pacific Islands and numerous Asian, African and European peoples, fasting has been used as a rite of initiation, marking puberty, prior to hunting and as part of the rites of marriage. In some cultures such as those in the Andaman Islands, Fiji, Samoa, China, Korea and others fasting is observed as a rite of mourning. In general, we find whenever human beings are in need, suppressed, or in fear, they seek God or higher powers through abstinence or penance. When our limited state of knowledge and consciousness is insufficient fasting guides us out of difficulties to find other means of inspiration and solutions. Ancient Egyptians, Greek, Roman, and Chinese cultures practiced fasting to cure various illnesses. The Egyptians believed that fasting three days a month helped to preserve good mental and physical health. The Greeks learned the virtues of fasting from the Egyptians and fasted before battle and the Romans followed suit. Socrates and Plato are known to have regularly performed fasts of ten days duration. Today in the West, fasting is used by alternative and naturopathic systems of medicine and healing for curing a host of acute and chronic diseases and as a useful catalyst in helping the body mobilize its own natural immune system. The Old Testament often refers to fasting: David chastened his soul with fasting, while Moses fasted for forty days when he ascended the mount to receive the tablets of the covenant. Daniel fasted for three weeks, supplicating and praying all the while. Jews observe six obligatory fasts during the year, one such being Yom Kippur. The institution of fasting and abstinence from certain foods in Christianity has its origin in the New Testament as it relates to the fasting of Jesus\u2019 disciples for several days during Lent, the forty-day period before Easter. The duration of the fast during Lent varied throughout the ages, until forty days accompanied by strict rules became the norm. Additional fasts were introduced later in different parts of the Church, such as the fast of Rogation Days, the Ember Weeks, the Whitsun Week, and fasts were also ordained by the Roman Catholic Church. Considerable variations in the practice of fasting are noticed between the Orthodox Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Reformed Churches of Europe. Over time there has been a gradual mitigation in the frequency and rigor of the fasts and abstinences prescribed by Church laws due to extenuating circumstances such as age, health, poverty, hard or continued labor and changing social conditions. Today few are obliged to fast strictly, while some are excused even from abstinence. Roman Catholic legislation further provides for dispensations to be granted by the Church authorities. The overall result is that the practice of fasting has declined and is almost forgotten as a religious exercise. During the twentieth century fasting has sometimes been used as a tool of political and social protest by individuals as well as groups. During the national struggles for independence from colonial rule, several leaders of the third world in Asia and Africa resorted to fasting to highlight their plight and struggle, often with some success.","title":"Fasting in History"},{"location":"guides/fasting/#the-islamic-fast","text":"For Muslims fasting, or sawm in Arabic, was commanded in the Qur\u2019an as a major obligatory spiritual discipline for the duration of the month of Ramadan. The Arabic word for fasting is derived from the root, \u2018sama\u2019, meaning to abstain from food, drink, smoking, sensual gratifications, wrong actions, harmful intentions, thoughts, words and deeds. Islamic fasting is obligatory for one month in every lunar year, that is, Ramadan, the ninth month in the Islamic calendar. All healthy adults are expected to adhere to the proper rules of fasting. In addition to this obligatory fast, there are many optional fasts, some of which occur regularly every week or month, and some that are scattered throughout the year. These fasts are Sunnah, or the practice of the Prophet. Fasting is also used as a penance for breaking an oath and as a compensation for some other religious obligation. The fast of Ramadan begins with the physical sighting of the new moon. Throughout the month a Muslim may not eat or drink from daybreak (when a fine strip of light may be seen on the horizon) until the sun has set. Before dawn a small meal ( suhur ) is usually recommended to be taken, although not obligatory, and the fast is broken just before the sunset ( maghrib ) prayer traditionally with dates and water, to be immediately followed by the prayer. Later on a larger meal is partaken by the entire family, often shared with relatives, friends and guests. The daily fast is begun by formulating the intention to perform the fast as a rite by making a clear intention (niyyah) to observe the fast. No one should fast if their health cannot sustain it or if a fast should threaten one\u2019s health. Pregnant and nursing women whose health may be harmed are exempted, as are those who are travelling away from home. When health is restored or other conditions for not fasting are removed (such as menstruation) then the person is expected to make up the fast later during the course of the year. Ramadan offers the believer an opportunity to mark an end to daily indulgences, or at least to impose clear limits on a daily basis for the duration of a month. This daily restraint breaks the habitual patterns of the self and constitutes a purification both of body and spirit, which brings about renewal of strength and greater spiritual awareness. Each and every ritualistic practice of Islam disciplines the individual and strengthens Muslim society if applied thoroughly. Every year the month of Ramadan falls at different times because the lunar calendar is shorter than the solar by approximately ten days. This means that as the period of the fast is brought forward annually, Ramadan will fall during all seasons of the year in a gradual progression. Despite the strict rules and restraint induced by the fast, Ramadan is usually a joyful time for Muslims everywhere. The last ten nights of the month, particularly the odd nights, are the spiritual highlights of Ramadan, for one of these nights is Laylat al-Qadr, the Night of Determination, in which the Qur\u2019an was first revealed to the Prophet. During these nights Muslims spend their nights in supplication and prayer, hoping to favorably influence the course of events that will unfold subsequently. Ramadan comes to a close with the celebrations and prayers of Eid al-Fitr . On this day a Muslim will give appropriate alms to the poor, and families gather for a light morning repast after the congregational prayer. The Eid prayer, usually performed outdoors is accompanied by a discourse delivered by the prayer leader after which people exchange good wishes and celebrate their success in performing a most important act of worship and attaining a heightened awareness and purposefulness in life. The Prophet of Allah said: \"The root of Islam is prayer, its branches are the obligatory tax, its height is the fast, and its expanse is striving in the way of Allah.\" He also said: \"The tax of the body is fasting.\" A Jew who was one of the most learned of his people asked the Messenger of Allah: \"Why did Allah make it obligatory upon your people to fast throughout the day for thirty days?\" The Prophet replied: \"When Adam ate from the tree it remained within his stomach for thirty days, so Allah made it obligatory upon his offspring to experience thirty days of hunger and thirst. Whatever they eat at night is a grace from Allah. Thus it was with Adam, so Allah made the same obligatory for my people.\" Then he recited the verse: \"The fast is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you.\" Qur'an, 2:183 Imam al\u2011Rida wrote the following concerning the obligation to fast: \"It is so that one may know the feeling of hunger and thirst, so that he will be humble and helpless, in order to be an indication of the difficulties of the Hereafter. Within it is contained the breaking of desires so that one will experience the deprivations caused by withholding from the poor and the needy.\" Imam al\u2011Sadiq relates that the Prophet said: \"The fast is a shield, that is, a veil protecting one from the afflictions of the world and from the punishment of the Hereafter. Thus, when you fast, make the intention to restrain your self from its desires and cut off the thoughts inspired by Shaytan. Bring yourself to the place where you are content without the desire for food or drink.\" The purpose of the fast is to deaden the desires of the self; it is a cleansing for the heart and the body and a revival of both the inner and the outer. It also includes given by those who stand in need before Allah gratitude for the grace and goodness bestowed. It increases humility, meekness, and tears, and causes one to seek refuge with Allah. The reason food is permitted during the night is because Allah does not make one responsible for more than one can endure. Allah has made it easy for us, which is the main characteristic of the shari`ah . Previously it has been said that Adam performed his fast in the daytime, that his repentance ( tawbah ) was accepted at the time of the afternoon prayer, and that he was freed of transgression at the time of the sunset prayer. This tradition is observed every day during one month so that during this time one may rid oneself of wrong actions and then be joyous in one\u2019s liberation from them by eating after sunset. The degrees of fasting can be arranged in the following manner: The first and lowest of them is that the person fasting limits himself to refraining from those things which would render his fast null and void but not from doing those things which are considered reprehensible. This is the fast of the general masses. The second is to restrain the body from whatever is considered reprehensible. Consequently, one guards his tongue against slander, his eyes against desire, and so on with the rest of his body. This represents the fast of the people of tariqah . The third, in addition to the above, is to protect the heart from going astray and from the whisperings of Shaytan, limiting it to the Remembrance of Allah and the witnessing of Him in all His manifestations. This represents the fast of the Chosen Few and is perfection itself.","title":"The Islamic Fast"},{"location":"guides/fasting/#meaning-and-benefits-of-fasting","text":"The fast is to refrain from specific things during certain specified intervals of time. Among its stipulations is the soundness of the intention covering a specific time period, for example, the month of Ramadan, or for the purpose of fulfilling an oath ( nadhar ). The intention which specifies the type of fast must also be made at the time when it is begun. There are various categories of fasts and each has its particular regulations: obligatory fasts, recommended fasts, fasts for specific oaths, and fasts for non\u2011specific oaths. Those actions which require a fast to be made up ( qada\u2019 ) or expiated ( kaff\u0101rah ) are nine in number and are as follows (as per the teachings of Ahl ul-Bayt): Eating. Drinking. Sexual intercourse. Intentional ejaculation. Intentionally telling a lie concerning Allah, His Messenger, or the Imams. Complete submersion in water. Intentionally taking in thick dust in the throat (e.g. flour or anything similar). Intentionally remaining in a state of jan\u0101bah (ritual impurity) until after fajr. Going back to sleep after having already awakened before fajr. The kaff\u0101rah or expiation consists of fasting for two consecutive months, or feeding sixty people in need, or freeing a slave (this ruling remains even though slavery is no longer practiced, while the more likely practice will be the two former). One may choose one of the above. There are eight actions which will break the fast and will require the Muslim to make up a fast without expiation: Eating, drinking, or engaging in sexual intercourse before confirming whether or not it is actually sunrise. Not accepting it when someone (reliable) says that it is sunrise. Following someone else who says that it is not yet sunrise when one is able to observe it oneself that it is indeed already sunrise. Following someone else who says it is night when one is able to ascertain it oneself. Breaking the fast (ift\u0101r) before its time has arrived; e.g. when in the presence of some obstruction (such as clouds) in the sky which makes it appear to be dark, and then it becomes clear that it is not yet the time of ift\u0101r. Returning to sleep after having already awakened once before taking a ritual bath from jan\u0101bah and not awakening again until after the sun has risen. Water entering the throat for those seeking to cool themselves (but this does not include the rinsing of the mouth in preparation for prayer)8. Finally, taking an enema. For the more mature Muslim, fasting means to abstain from anything which would be displeasing to their Lord and contrary to His commandment and prohibition, either in word or deed. The Messenger of Allah said: \"Everything has a door and the door to acts of devotion is fasting.\" The more advanced seeker abstains from whatever is forbidden and restrains the self. Fasting is a deep link between the seeker and his Lord which no one observes but Allah, in contrast to prayer, the obligatory tax, and the various other actions which are possible for others to notice (and therefore possibly motivated by the desire for acclaim or out of pride). \"Whoever wants to meet his Lord, then let him perform good actions and not see anything other than Allah in the worship of his Lord.\" [18:110] Seeing other than Allah (shirk) in this context refers to performing an act of worship for the eyes of someone other than Allah. The Prophet said: \"The infiltration of shirk within my people is more hidden than the creeping of a black ant on a black stone on a dark night.\" Islamic scholars say that this type of shirk refers to the performance of an act of worship for one\u2019s own reputation of piety or other worldly position. The men of inner knowledge say that it means \u2018to see anything other than the One\u2019, as Imam `Ali has said: \"The lowest form of riy\u0101\u2019 (worship performed to be seen by other than Allah) is shirk.\" There is no question of riy\u0101\u2019 if one sees no one but Allah. Open or hidden shirk will inevitably be weakened by cutting back desires and appetites, as Imam `Ali said: \"Shaytan flows through man like blood so constrict his passageways by hunger.\" The Messenger of Allah said: \"The gates of the garden are opened when Ramadan begins and the gates of the Fire are closed.\"","title":"Meaning and Benefits of Fasting"},{"location":"guides/fasting/#outward-abstentions","text":"1. Abstention of the Tongue This concerns useless, foolish, or discourteous speech, as well as anything which would be contrary to what pleases Allah. The Prophet said: \"Whoever is silent is saved.\" \"When the discussion reaches Allah, then be silent.\" \"Whoever knows his Lord, his tongue becomes still.\" That is to say, one is incapable of speaking about the absolute Source and Essence. Divine knowledge is to be tasted and witnessed personally and the tongue is incapable of expressing what is beyond the senses and the mind. The Messenger of Allah said: \"Whoever speaks too much speaks frivolously. Whoever speaks frivolously has little modesty. Whoever has little modesty has little restraint, and whoever has little restraint enters the Fire.\" 2. Abstention of the Eyes This involves restraining them from seeing whatever is forbidden according to the shari`ah of Islam. \"Tell the people of faith to avert their eyes and to guard their private parts.\" Qur'an, 24:30 Lowering the gaze is expected from the serious seeker. Desires that arise from seeing can cause distractions that can be subtle and subconscious as well as gross and action-oriented. A blind person may be spared these distractions (unless he or she regains his/her sight). 3. Abstention of the Ears The ears must be restrained from hearing whatever is forbidden in shari`ah, like slander and gossip, music and songs that entice lower tendencies, and listening to the talk of the misguided and the corrupt. 4. Abstention of the Sense of Smell This refers to abstaining from both foul odours as well as exciting scents. Foul odours cause aversion and disgust, whereas sweet scent may excite desires and pleasures. 5. Abstention of the Sense of Taste The meaning here relates to avoidance of whatever may veil the faculty of reason, such as imbibing intoxicating beverages, or by acquiring a taste for usury and unfair profit, abuse of orphans, the poor and the weak, and various other \u2018prohibitive\u2019 tastes and habits which will hinder one\u2019s spiritual progress. \"And do not approach the property of the orphan except in the best manner.\" Qur'an, 6:152 \"But those who take usury will rise up on the Day of Resurrection like someone tormented by Satan\u2019s touch.\" Qur'an, 2:275 6. Abstention of the Sense of Touch This relates to abstaining from touching whatever may lead to forbidden actions, or to excesses in permitted actions, or to go beyond the limits of balance. \"They will say to their skins, \u201cwhy have you testified against us?\u201d They will reply: \u201cAllah has caused us to speak, it is He who gives speech to everything and He created you in the first instance and to Him you will return.\" Qur'an, 41:21 \"Nor were you discreet lest your ears or your eyes or your skins testify against you.\" Qur'an, 41:22 The senses have been created to function in harmony and balance regarding worldly interactions. Anyone who uses the body and its various parts in a manner for which it was not created is considered to be a wrongdoer and out of balance, which is the opposite of harmony, and, therefore, of justice. One explanation of the following verse: \"And the places of prostration (mas\u0101jid) are for Allah, so therefore do not call upon anyone with Allah\" Qur'an, 72:18 is that the human points of prostration include the seven points where the physical body touches the ground. These include the forehead, the two hands, the two knees, and the two feet. These places of prostration are for Allah: they belong to Him and are His slaves, so do not use them in anything which is not pleasing to Him or in anything for which they were not created.","title":"Outward Abstentions"},{"location":"guides/fasting/#inner-abstentions","text":"There are five inner abstentions: 1. Worldly Concerns The First Abstention refers to restraining the mind from being occupied with base or worldly concerns. The mind is where reasoning and intellect are developed for interaction with the world. When used properly they lead to rational and good understanding. The Prophet has taught that the contemplation of one hour is better than the actions of seventy years. 2. Useful Knowledge The Second Abstention is to use the mind and intellect to learn about creation and appropriate boundaries and limitations. \"\u2026those who preserve Allah\u2019s limits.\" Qur'an, 9:112 3. The Imagination The Third Abstention involves restraining the imaginal power. In Arabic, this is called the khay\u0101l \u2013 the faculty which enables us to construct entities or ideas which do not physically exist, such as a \u2018flying cat\u2019. During fasts, we must limit its activites to the purpose for which it was created, which is the perception of things in their true higher reality without being overcome by fantasy and foolish imagery. Allah did not create this power for any reason other than to deduce the meaning behind the world of matter. The power of imagination inspired the Pharaoh and his people to imagine that the transformation of the staff of Musa into a serpent was merely a result of magic. 4. Illusions The Fourth Abstention is restraining the power of illusion (and values or meanings given to events or situations) which makes one hate someone one minute and love someone else the next. This wahm prevents one from steadfastness and perseverance on the path of spiritual evolvement. It will cause one to fall prey to the delusion of love and hate and other confusions. Whoever possesses a \"Tranquil Soul\" is free of all of this as he is in the station of witnessing his Beloved and His acts, and \"anything the Beloved does is loved\". Whoever is in this state of witnessing One Reality has no enmity for anyone nor concern. Allah addresses the one who has attained this station: \"O soul that art at rest! Return to your Lord pleased [with Him] and well-pleasing [Him]\". Qur'an, 89:27-28 Whoever truly fasts is the one who possesses a soul that is at rest or tranquil and is not possessed or controlled by his lower self. 5. Combined Senses The Fifth Abstention deals with restraining the combined senses as they manifest themselves, both in subjective thoughts ( wahm ) and in the imagination, and as they constantly appear to the self in both form and meaning. This is naturally an obstacle to progress on the Path, because anyone who is occupied with the senses is veiled from the real significance that lies behind them. Likewise, anyone who is preoccupied with their illusions and self-given values will be veiled from true meaning. The \"One who is veiled, is veiled, regardless of whether it is by one veil or a thousand.\" Consequently, the one who fasts must abstain from the likes of these so that he may be free of all veils and witness his Beloved in the manner we have discussed.","title":"Inner abstentions"},{"location":"guides/fasting/#there-is-only-allah","text":"The People of Allah consider the self to be like a tree with ten branches. Each branch naturally takes its share of nutrients which the tree imbibes from the earth. If, however, we suppose that nine of these branches are cut off then the power of those branches and the nutrients which originally went to them would now go to the one remaining branch; it would grow larger and its fruit would be sweeter and bigger. So it is with the self of man. If man ceases to be attached to the world which surrounds him and his attachment is to the trunk then no doubt the fruits of his thought will be loftier, greater, more powerful, and more honorable. The fast of the Gnostic consists of abstaining from witnessing anything other than Allah. Consequently, anyone fasting at this level abstains from anything other than their Beloved, for they assert that there is nothing in existence other than Allah (the Exalted), Allah\u2019s Names, Attributes and Actions; thus, everything relates to Allah, by Allah, and from Allah. This is because anybody who does not restrain his self from witnessing other than Allah is a mushrik, and the fast of the mushrik is not accepted, nor is his prayer, because praying and fasting cleanse the inner from the impurity of seeing another with Allah, and from the illusion of the grossness and the filth of \u2018otherness\u2019 with the water of Unity and the light of faith based on knowledge. It is obvious in prayer and other acts of worship that one cannot cleanse the inner unless the outer is cleansed by way of wudu or ghusl . Likewise, the fast is not valid for the mushrik, whether his shirk be open or concealed, because every mushrik rejects Reality (i.e. a k\u0101fir ) and every k\u0101fir is a mushrik , as Allah has stated: \"And whoever associates (others) with Allah has indeed gone far astray.\" Qur'an, 4:116 The following verse elucidates the meaning of concealed shirk: \"Thus whoever seeks to meet his Lord then let him do good actions and not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord.\" Qur'an, 18:110 If this is an allusion to one who was openly associating others with Allah, Allah would have said: \u2018\u2026and not associate anyone with his Lord.\u2019 But when He says \u2018in the worship of his Lord\u2019 we know that this is an allusion to one who secretly or inadvertently associates others with Allah, who are referred to as being \u2018believers\u2019 and \u2018Muslims\u2019, as Allah has said: \"And most of them do not believe in Allah without associating (others with Him).\" Qur'an, 12:106 And recall what the Prophet said: \"The infiltration of shirk into my people is more hidden than the creeping of a black ant upon a black stone on a dark night.\"","title":"There is Only Allah"},{"location":"guides/fasting/#the-awakend-seeker","text":"The awakened seeker must give up the illusion of seeing actions as coming from other than Allah so that by this realization he may arrive at the station of the Unity of Action. Then he must go past the illusion of seeing Attributes other than those of Allah. That is the station of the Unity of Attributes. Finally, he must go past the veil of \u2018independent\u2019 entities or events \u2013 in Truth, there is no Reality except the One Reality, Allah. That is the station of the Unity of Essence, which is the goal of the Path, and indeed, the goal of existence itself. Shaykh Ahmad al\u2011`Alawi said that whoever has arrived at this station cannot see anything other than Allah even if he intends to do so. He also said that when it is established within one\u2019s self that it is an obligation to abstain from anything other than Allah, the self will begin to long for the knowledge of Allah, and this is like what occurs with the rising of the crescent moon of Ramadan: \"Whoever among you witnesses the month, let him fast\u2026\" Qur'an, 2:185 This station is that of witnessing or seeing, first outwardly and then in the subtle spiritual realms, and whoever does not raise his head will not witness the spiritual realms of the heavens and the earth. The determination and concern of the seeker should not be concentrated in the senses as this will cause the heart to turn away from witnessing the Lord. It is for this reason that he abandons everything which reaches him by way of the senses. The seeker will not be able to concentrate his will and direction until he is detached from his senses. The senses may dominate the outward, as one of the Masters has said that the senses will obliterate meaning unless the senses become the essence of meaning themselves. Shaykh al\u2011`Alawi says that the self of the seeker is afflicted by separation which is often expressed as being in a state of jan\u0101bah ; absorption in Allah, then, is forbidden to him and the veil will descend upon him because of the existence of this obstacle. When the barrier is removed, then the seeker is obliged to make up whatever he missed. Allah has warned those who are not patient with \"one food (Qur'an, 2:61), that is, with the Unity of Essence, and who long for anything other than that from among the realms of creation, when He said: \"Would you exchange that which is good for that which is low and base? Then go down to a city and your wish will be granted\u2026\" Qur'an, 2:61 The significance of \u2018city\u2019 here is that it represents the consuming self with all that it contains of desires and expectations both open and hidden. This is alluded to in: \"\u2026from whatever the earth causes to grow of greens, cucumbers, garlic, lentils and onions.\" Qur'an, 2:61 Here Allah alludes to the desires of the self which lead to degradation: \"\u2026and they were afflicted with degradation and helplessness and were forced to endure anger from Allah.\" Qur'an, 2:61 This is the state when the lower self is in command and the way out is to take strength by way of the friendship of Allah. For this reason it is said that if you want strength which will not vanish, then do not take pride in strength which will vanish. Whoever fasts the fast of haqiqah , and consequently abstains from anything other than Allah, is fasting according to the following hadith qudsi : \"For every good action there is the recompense of ten to seven hundred times its worth except fasting, for, indeed, it is solely for Me and I shall surely be the reward.\" At the earlier phases of spiritual evolvement, the fast is rewarded by the Garden, joy, houris and palaces, or by nearness, attainment, unveiling, and witnessing. At the advanced level the fast has its reward in Allah Himself, the Granter of rewards. The difference between the fast of the people of tariqah and that of the people of haqiqah is that the former is a means for refining the behavior and taking on the Attributes of Allah, as the Prophet said: \"Mould your character with Allah\u2019s Attributes.\" The fast of the people of haqiqah , on the other hand, is a means of attaining annihilation and of cleansing oneself by Allah in the station of Pure Unity, which is referred to as annihilation in Unity; as Allah has said in a hadith qudsi : \"Whoever has sought Me has found Me. Whoever has found Me has come to know Me. Whoever has known Me has loved Me. Whoever has loved Me I have slain. Whomever I have slain the payment of the blood money is on Me, and I will Myself be the payment for the blood money that I owe.\" One relevant example often given is that of a lump of charcoal and fire. Suppose that there is a strong fire which is described in terms of light, burning, and heat, and that next to it lays charcoal which may be described as dark and cold. As this charcoal is gradually moved closer to the fire, we see that it begins to take on the same characteristics as the fire as fire begins to glow from the charcoal itself. Thus, the charcoal becomes fire and no longer remains charcoal. \"These parables We make for the people and they are not understood except by the wise.\" Qur'an, 29:43","title":"The Awakend Seeker"},{"location":"guides/fasting/#the-feast-of-fast-breaking","text":"This feast that marks the end of the month of fasting alludes to the breaking of the fast which cannot be realized as long as the seeker\u2019s senses are suppressed, for during the correct fast the senses are made redundant.

Pilgrimage consists of both obligatory actions and voluntary actions. The Obligatory Actions are of two types: absolute and restricted (to certain circumstances. The absolute is that the pilgrimage should be the Pilgrimage of Islam, which is fulfilled when the following conditions are met: Maturity Sound mind Freedom Health Easy availability of provisions and means of transport Sufficient funds and the existence of a means of obtaining one\u2019s livelihood The emptying of the innermost distractions (great fears, attachments etc.) The possibility of making the journey. Other basic conditions for Hajj are Islam, maturity of mind, and the power of reasoning. If these requirements are met then one must perform the pilgrimage once within one\u2019s lifetime. With regards to obligations that are restricted in their scope, they are obligatory only if there is a cause which makes them binding (i.e. oaths or contracts). There are three types of Pilgrimage: tamattu` , qaran and ifrad . The tamattu` pilgrimage is obligatory for whomever does not have his family living in the vicinity of the Ka`bah. The qaran and the ifrad are obligatory upon those who have come to the Ka`bah from a distance of 12 miles (or more) in any direction from the House of Allah. The actions of pilgrimage are of two types: obligatory and non\u2011obligatory (preferred voluntary actions). Furthermore the obligatory actions are also of two types: rukn , an action which if omitted nullifies the pilgrimage, and non\u2011rukn , obligatory actions which, if mistakenly omitted, will not nullify the entire pilgrimage. Important Pillars Of the three types of pilgrimage mentioned above, the pillars of the tamattu` pilgrimage are eight in number; four of them are restricted to the `umrah and four to the pilgrimage. The pillars of the `umrah are: Intention ( niyyah ). Assuming the state of ihr\u0101m, including donning the garment at the \"Station for Commencing the Pilgrimage\" ( miq\u0101t ) at the proper time. The taw\u0101f of the `umrah . The Hastening ( sa`y ) between Safa and Marwa. Those which are relevant to Hajj are: The Intention for the Pilgrimage. The Pause at `Arafat. The Pause at Muzdalifah. The Hastening of the Pilgrimage. There are eight actions which are obligatory but not considered to be Pillars: The uttering of the four phrases of Labayk (if one is able to; if not, whatever is said in its place); the two rak`\u0101t of the Taw\u0101f of the `umrah ; the joined prayers after the Hastening; the uttering of the words \"Labayk\" at the time of assuming the state of ihr\u0101m for the pilgrimage (or whatever is done in its place); the sacrifice or that which takes its place in the way of fasting if one is unable to perform it; the two rak`\u0101t of the Taw\u0101f of the pilgrimage; and the taw\u0101f al\u2011nis\u0101\u2019 and its two rak`\u0101t . The Pillars of the qaran and the ifrad are five in number: The Ihr\u0101m The Pause at `Arafat. The Pause at Muzdalifah. The Circumambulation of the Ziy\u0101rah. The Hastening. The actions which are considered to be non-rukn are four in number: The uttering of the words \"Labayka\" or what is done in its place. The two rak`\u0101t of the Taw\u0101f of the Ziy\u0101rah. The taw\u0101f al\u2011nis\u0101\u2019 . The two rak`\u0101t of the taw\u0101f\u2011al\u2011nis\u0101\u2019 . The qaran is distinguished from the ifrad by the performance of the sacrifice. It is preferable ( mustahabb ) to utter the \"Labayka\" at the beginning of each circumambulation for both of them. There are many actions that are considered to be voluntary, preferable actions. One should refer to the books which specifically deal with the pilgrimage for details concerning them. This, then, is the pilgrimage of the people of shari`ah according to the way of the House of the Prophet. The Pilgrimage of the Adepts At the next level the advanced pilgrim will visit the House of Allah \u2013 the Spiritual Ka`bah. This sacred House can be considered from two viewpoints: from that of the \u2018Horizons\u2019 (i.e. the macrocosm) and from that of the self (i.e. the microcosm). With regard to the \u2018Horizons\u2019, this refers to the original human ( ins\u0101n ) heart, also called the \u2018Universal Self\u2019, \"the Visited House\" (Qur'an, 52:4) and the \"Preserved Tablet\" (Qur'an, 85:22\". The \u2018self\u2019 as used here refers to the heart of lesser man which is referred to as the \"heart, the breast, or the articulating self.\" The former of these two, that is, the \u2018Horizons\u2019, are the Qiblah of the people of haqiqah and the latter is the Qiblah of the people of tariqah . The way the people of tariqah go to and turn towards their Qiblah rests upon what has come to us in the tradition that the first House which extended over the water and appeared upon the face of the water was the Ka`bah. This was before the existence of the earth and whatever was made upon it, according to the Prophet\u2019s words: \"The Ka`bah was the first House which appeared upon the face of the water at the time of the creation of the Heavens. He created it \u2026 before the creation of the earth.\" Allah said: \"Surely the first House which was established for the people was the one in Bakkah (Makkah), as a blessing and as a guidance for the worlds. In it are clear signs, the station of Abraham, and whoever enters it is secure, and Allah has obliged the people to make the pilgrimage to the House for whoever can make his way to it, and as for him who defies the commandment, Allah is independent from all of the worlds.\" Qur'an, 3:96\u201197 The tradition and the verse demonstrate that there is both a physical Ka`bah and a spiritual Ka`bah and each of them has two aspects. One of its aspects is the physical masjid which is called al\u2011Masjid ul\u2011Har\u0101m (The Sacred Mosque). The other division is the physical heart, which is also called al\u2011Masjid ul\u2011Har\u0101m . Another aspect is the Greater Heart of Man, which is referred to as the \u2018Universal Soul\u2019, and the other division is the Lesser Heart of Man, which is referred to as the \u2018Differentiated Articulating Self\u2019. The first Reality which manifested within the spiritual realm from the Greater Soul was the Soul of Man, of which it is said that the first thing that Allah created was the soul or reasoning, and it was the Qiblah of haqiqah which was called the Universal Soul; as Allah has said: \"O people fear your Lord Who created you from one soul.\" Qur'an, 4:1 Similarly, the first form which manifested within the physical realm, which is referred to as the \u2018earth\u2019, was the form of the physical Ka`bah; as Allah has said: \"Surely the first House established for the people was the one in Bakkah (Makkah), as a blessing and a guidance for the worlds\u2026\" Qur'an, 3:96 The first Reality which manifested within the spiritual realm from the Lesser Soul of Man, referred to in His words: \"\u2026and when I formed it and blew into it by way of My Soul,\" Qur'an, 15:29 was the Qiblah of haqiqah , which is referred to in the words of the hadith qudsi : \"My earth and My heavens cannot contain Me, but the heart of My slave who has faith contains Me.\" The first form which manifested within the physical realm, that is the \u2018body\u2019, was the form of the physical heart, referred to as the \u2018breast\u2019, of which Allah has said: \"Have We not expanded your breast?\" Qur'an, 94:1 Thus, just as the spiritual Ka`bah may be understood from the physical Ka`bah, the existence of the spiritual heart, which is the lesser Heart of Man, may be understood from the existence of the physical heart, by virtue of: \"We shall show them Our signs on the horizons and in their souls so that the Truth will become clear to them.\" Qur'an, 41:53 It may also be understood from the verse: \"It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and His Throne was upon the water.\" Qur'an, 11:7 The Throne (the structural blueprint) existed before the creation of the physical heavens and earth and is built upon the foundation of the spiritual essences consisting of reasoning and souls. \u2018Throne\u2019 here means the spiritual throne which is the Primal Reasoning. If the meaning of the word \u2018Throne\u2019 refers to the physical Throne, which is the greater cycle of the heavens, then the meaning of the term \u2018water\u2019 signifies physical water. It has also been said that the term \u2018water\u2019 here signifies divine knowledge which is the foundation of all phenomena. Distinguishing it by placing the Throne over it is to signify its vastness and greatness. If we suppose the water upon which the Throne rests is a drop from the Greater Man (the Macrocosm), from the standpoint of form as it is determined to be among the Men of Allah, then the water represents physical water and its manifestation signifies its relationship to the drop from which all forms in the world spring. It is also thus with regard to the Lesser Soul of Man (i.e. the microcosm) which is derived from a drop of sperm. The microcosm is identical to the Macrocosm in all aspects of meaning. The Pilgrimage of the Gnostic This consists of spiritually turning in the direction of the greater Heart of Man, which is the Supreme House of Allah and which is referred to as the \u2018Visited House\u2019, the \u2018Sacred Presence\u2019 and the \u2018Universal Soul\u2019. This is in contrast to the Pilgrimage of the people of tariqah which is directed to the Lesser Heart of Humankind. The authority over the differential (individual) soul, which is the soul of the Lesser Man, cannot exist anywhere but within the mind. Likewise the authority over the Universal Soul which is the soul of the Greater Man, and which is referred to as the universe, cannot exist anywhere but within the Throne (similar, in this instance, to the mind). Furthermore, in the same way that it initially manifests within the Lesser Man as the physical heart, which is the fountainhead of life, so too it is that its initial manifestation within the Greater Man is the Fourth Celestial Sphere, which is the celestial sphere of the sun, the fountainhead of life in the world. Thus it is like the breast of the Greater Man with the sun being like the physical heart within it. The heart of haqiqah is the Universal Soul, which is also called the \u2018Preserved Tablet\u2019, the \u2018Clear Book\u2019 and \u2018Adam of the Haqiqah\u2019. Allah alludes to it in the verse: \"O people, fear your Lord Who created you from One Soul and He created its mate from it.\" Qur'an, 4:1 The Soul of the Fourth Celestial Sphere is like the animal soul which is in the heart. All parts of the body receive life from it. It is the well-known \u2018Visited House\u2019 of the shari`ah , the Fourth Heaven, and it is by it that Allah makes an oath in the verse: \"By the Mountain and inscribed Book on a fine outstretched parchment and the Visited House and elevated canopy and the overflowing sea.\" Qur'an, 52:1\u20116 The \u2018mountain\u2019 represents the Throne, and the \u2018inscribed Book\u2019 represents the Universal Soul which is the heart of the universe. The \u2018fine outstretched parchment\u2019 represents the Eighth Celestial Sphere, which is its manifestation. The \u2018elevated canopy\u2019 may be the Throne or it may represent the earthly sky. The \u2018Visited House\u2019 may represent the Fourth Celestial Sphere and it may represent the Universal Soul. The \u2018overflowing sea\u2019 is filled with forms and may represent the Realm of the Barrier, or interspace or barrier ( barzakh ), which lies between the two worlds of the spiritual and physical, and is referred to as the shadow realm and is filled with the form of everything in creation. The Ka`bah represents the Universal Soul which is called the Supreme House of Allah; its appearance on the water is an allusion to the spiritual realms which originate from it before the physical realms. \"It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and His Throne was upon the water.\" Qur'an, 11:7 This could mean that before the creation of the physical heavens and earth the Throne was upon their two spiritual counterparts, reasoning and the self, if by the term \u2018Throne\u2019 we mean the spiritual Throne which is the Primal Reasoning. It is possible that the water is an allusion to the basic matter from which the universe was created. Furthermore, it is possible that this was before \u2018the splitting asunder\u2019 during the time of unity when all primordial matter was in one state, when reasoning, the soul, and the Throne were one Reality. The \u2018First House\u2019 which has been alluded to is the Universal Soul and the word \u2018Bakkah\u2019, is an allusion to the Eighth Celestial Sphere, which is termed the Dais (kursiy) and as \u2018Blessed\u2019 \u2013 an allusion to the blessing of knowledge and truth which surround it and which descend from it to the rest of creation below it. \u2018A guidance for the world\u2019 is an allusion to its overflowing grace and illumination for all of the worlds. \u2018The station of Abraham\u2019 is an allusion to the arrival of the spiritual traveler, by means of it, to the station of the all\u2011inclusive oneness of the haqiqah of Abraham. Allah says the following concerning this: \"And in this way We show Abraham the dominion of the heavens and the earth so that he may be among the certain.\" Qur'an, 6:75 \"\u2026and whoever has entered it is secure.\" Qur'an, 3:97 These words indicate that whoever enters the House in the manner mentioned above will be secure from all suspicion and doubt regarding the cosmic Divine sanctity. He will be secure from the two forms of associating others with Allah, i.e. openly and secretly. \"\u2026And Allah has obliged the people to make the Pilgrimage to the House\u2026\" Qur'an, 3:97 That is to say, from the standpoint of spiritual knowledge, of witnessing, unveiling, and viewing an obligation rests upon the people who are ready for this station to go to that House in this manner. The verse \"\u2026whoever is able to make his way to it,\" Qur'an, 3:97 is an indication of His having distinguished a particular group of people who are able to do it by virtue of their appropriate knowledge and good action. Useful knowledge is attained in two ways. Either directly from Allah without any human intermediary, referred to as revelation, inspiration and unveiling, or through the medium of the men of knowledge, like His Prophets and Messengers. They are alluded to in: \"Read: And your Lord is the Most Generous, He who taught with the pen,\" Qur'an, 96:3\u20114 and: \"\u2026and when Allah made a covenant with those who were given the Book: You shall certainly make it known to men and you shall not hide it. And they cast it behind their backs and took a small price for it; so wretched is that which they have purchased.\" Qur'an, 3:187 Good actions also have two aspects: One relates to the people of shari`ah and tariqah, and refers to good and purifying actions, with no trace of doubt or suspicion and which is performed purely and sincerely for Allah. The other aspect is distinctly for the people of haqiqah and the people of attainment, and this is not known or witnessed by anyone in existence except by Allah: \"So whoever wants to meet his Lord, let him perform a good action and not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord.\" Qur'an, 18:110 Stations of the Self Thus, whoever desires to go on the Pilgrimage of the gnostics must assume the state of ihr\u0101m from witnessing the realms of the senses completely, by forbidding (i.e. making har\u0101m) his self from witnessing the physical universe and those worldly pleasures which are connected with it. Then he should direct his attention to the spiritual realm, which is the Sanctuary, Makkah or Bakkah, so that in fact he may attain it and become adorned with the Attributes of this spiritual realm and obtain its knowledge. Then he should direct his attention to the Ka`bah of Haqiqah, which is the Universal Soul and its knowledge and truths, and make seven taw\u0101fs around it. The seven stations of the self are: The Commanding Self ( nafs al\u2011amm\u0101rah ) The Critical Self ( nafs al\u2011laww\u0101mah ) The Inspirational Self ( nafs al\u2011mulhamah ) The Tranquil Self ( nafs al\u2011mutma\u2019innah ) The Contented Self ( nafs al\u2011radiyah ) The Self which is the object of Allah\u2019s contentment ( nafs al\u2011mardiyah ) The Perfected Self ( nafs al\u2011k\u0101milah ) The levels of knowledge of the physical realm correspond to what has been called the \u2018Seven Levels of Qur\u2019anic Knowledge\u2019, of which there are numerous subdivisions, and have been indicated by the Prophet when he said: \"Indeed the Qur\u2019an possesses both an outward and an inward and its inward possesses an inward continuing to seven levels.\" Then the attention is turned to the station of Abraham, which is the station of Unity, and the Presence of Oneness, known as the Primal Reasoning and the Supreme Soul. There he performs a prayer of two rak`\u0101t in thanksgiving for having arrived at that Presence. The two rak`\u0101t represent the annihilation from both the outer and the inner realms and whatever they contain of existence and creation, including himself. Then he hastens between Safa and Marwa (outer and inner worlds), to observe them once again with his effort and struggle in order to discontinue looking upon multiplicity by carefully examining the One Existence which lies behind it, and to become firmly established in the station of unity or gatheredness, which is his desired destination. Then he directs his attention to the Ka`bah once again in order to witness the Universal Soul and to observe its truths. He takes the ihr\u0101m of the Pilgrimage from it, which is beyond rationality, in the prescribed manner. Then he turns his attention to `Arafat (the station of the self). Turning one\u2019s attention to the `Arafat of the self is to turn the attention to the station of knowledge of haqiqah and there is no Presence after this Presence except the presence of the Essence, which no one can reach, for it has preceded and reached all before creation. In this station the arrival at the Unity of true gatheredness is attained, which is referred to as \u2018Muhammadi Unity\u2019. It is here that a man becomes a human ( ins\u0101n ) where the perfected being is perfected, and where the Master becomes a Master. For this reason they are obliged to return to the task of bringing others to perfection by returning to the realm of multiplicity, as Allah has said: \"\u2026and to warn their people when they return to them.\" Qur'an 9:122 When Shaykh Junayd was asked about the end destination, he replied: \"(It is) the return to the starting point.\" This is the secret of the return of the pilgrim from `Arafat to Mina, because it symbolizes the return to the realm of multiplicity. Then he occupies himself with the performance of the rituals of Mina, that is, the business of the outward world viz. the stoning, the sacrifice and the shaving of the head. He casts the stone of `Aqabah, which represents the world and its provision, casting it away without the possibility of returning, now that he lives the life of haqiqah (the real life): \"Do not reckon that those who have been killed in the way of Allah are dead; on the contrary, they are alive sustained with their Lord.\" Qur'an, 3:169 And: \"\u2026or is the one who has been dead and to whom We have restored life and made a light for him with which he walks among the people like the one who is within darkness from which he does not escape?\" Qur'an, 6:122 He then shaves his head, that is, he cuts the head of his self from the love of the world and its provision, thereby symbolizing that he will never allow his self to return again. Then he returns to the station of eternity, which is the ongoingness after annihilation, and he goes around the Ka`bah again in order to examine it once more from seven aspects in accordance with the state of his own creation, which is in seven stages; as Allah has said: \"\u2026He created you in stages\" Qur'an, 71:14 so that he may glimpse or experience the light of truth by way of that free movement within the seven regions of the earth and the seven celestial regions, which are referred to as Spiritual Regions and the Realm of Power respectively. Then he performs sal\u0101t at the station of Abraham, the Unity of Haqiqah, performing the two rak`\u0101t prayer of the Feast (Feast of the Sacrifice and Feast of the Fast Breaking), because of having become annihilated from every feast and because of his remaining eternally in a constant state of feasting in divine light, in the station of the Unity of Haqiqah. Finally he returns to Mina, to the world of multiplicity and the three stages which are mineral, plant and animal and stays there for three days of the Days of Allah, as Allah says: \"\u2026today I have completed for you your way of life (Islam) and I have perfected My Grace upon you and I am contented with Islam as a way of life for you.\" Qur'an, 5:3","title":"Pilgrimage"},{"location":"guides/pilgrimage/#the-different-kinds-of-pilgrimage","text":"Many of the key words used in this article are explained in full detail in this section of our glossary","title":"The Different Kinds of Pilgrimage"},{"location":"guides/pilgrimage/#the-pilgrimage-of-revealed-law","text":"The pilgrimage at this first level is to go to the Ka`bah, or Sacred House of Allah, to carry out the prescribed rituals which are to be performed at specific times.

With regard to the \u2018Horizons\u2019, this refers to the original human ( ins\u0101n ) heart, also called the \u2018Universal Self\u2019, \"the Visited House\" (Qur'an, 52:4) and the \"Preserved Tablet\" (Qur'an, 85:22\".

One of its aspects is the physical masjid which is called al\u2011Masjid ul\u2011Har\u0101m (The Sacred Mosque). The other division is the physical heart, which is also called al\u2011Masjid ul\u2011Har\u0101m . Another aspect is the Greater Heart of Man, which is referred to as the \u2018Universal Soul\u2019, and the other division is the Lesser Heart of Man, which is referred to as the \u2018Differentiated Articulating Self\u2019. The first Reality which manifested within the spiritual realm from the Greater Soul was the Soul of Man, of which it is said that the first thing that Allah created was the soul or reasoning, and it was the Qiblah of haqiqah which was called the Universal Soul; as Allah has said: \"O people fear your Lord Who created you from one soul.\" Qur'an, 4:1 Similarly, the first form which manifested within the physical realm, which is referred to as the \u2018earth\u2019, was the form of the physical Ka`bah; as Allah has said: \"Surely the first House established for the people was the one in Bakkah (Makkah), as a blessing and a guidance for the worlds\u2026\" Qur'an, 3:96 The first Reality which manifested within the spiritual realm from the Lesser Soul of Man, referred to in His words: \"\u2026and when I formed it and blew into it by way of My Soul,\" Qur'an, 15:29 was the Qiblah of haqiqah , which is referred to in the words of the hadith qudsi : \"My earth and My heavens cannot contain Me, but the heart of My slave who has faith contains Me.\" The first form which manifested within the physical realm, that is the \u2018body\u2019, was the form of the physical heart, referred to as the \u2018breast\u2019, of which Allah has said: \"Have We not expanded your breast?\" Qur'an, 94:1 Thus, just as the spiritual Ka`bah may be understood from the physical Ka`bah, the existence of the spiritual heart, which is the lesser Heart of Man, may be understood from the existence of the physical heart, by virtue of: \"We shall show them Our signs on the horizons and in their souls so that the Truth will become clear to them.\" Qur'an, 41:53 It may also be understood from the verse: \"It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and His Throne was upon the water.\" Qur'an, 11:7 The Throne (the structural blueprint) existed before the creation of the physical heavens and earth and is built upon the foundation of the spiritual essences consisting of reasoning and souls. \u2018Throne\u2019 here means the spiritual throne which is the Primal Reasoning. If the meaning of the word \u2018Throne\u2019 refers to the physical Throne, which is the greater cycle of the heavens, then the meaning of the term \u2018water\u2019 signifies physical water. It has also been said that the term \u2018water\u2019 here signifies divine knowledge which is the foundation of all phenomena. Distinguishing it by placing the Throne over it is to signify its vastness and greatness. If we suppose the water upon which the Throne rests is a drop from the Greater Man (the Macrocosm), from the standpoint of form as it is determined to be among the Men of Allah, then the water represents physical water and its manifestation signifies its relationship to the drop from which all forms in the world spring. It is also thus with regard to the Lesser Soul of Man (i.e. the microcosm) which is derived from a drop of sperm. The microcosm is identical to the Macrocosm in all aspects of meaning.","title":"The Pilgrimage of the Adepts"},{"location":"guides/pilgrimage/#the-pilgrimage-of-the-gnostic","text":"This consists of spiritually turning in the direction of the greater Heart of Man, which is the Supreme House of Allah and which is referred to as the \u2018Visited House\u2019, the \u2018Sacred Presence\u2019 and the \u2018Universal Soul\u2019. This is in contrast to the Pilgrimage of the people of tariqah which is directed to the Lesser Heart of Humankind. The authority over the differential (individual) soul, which is the soul of the Lesser Man, cannot exist anywhere but within the mind. Likewise the authority over the Universal Soul which is the soul of the Greater Man, and which is referred to as the universe, cannot exist anywhere but within the Throne (similar, in this instance, to the mind). Furthermore, in the same way that it initially manifests within the Lesser Man as the physical heart, which is the fountainhead of life, so too it is that its initial manifestation within the Greater Man is the Fourth Celestial Sphere, which is the celestial sphere of the sun, the fountainhead of life in the world. Thus it is like the breast of the Greater Man with the sun being like the physical heart within it. The heart of haqiqah is the Universal Soul, which is also called the \u2018Preserved Tablet\u2019, the \u2018Clear Book\u2019 and \u2018Adam of the Haqiqah\u2019. Allah alludes to it in the verse: \"O people, fear your Lord Who created you from One Soul and He created its mate from it.\" Qur'an, 4:1 The Soul of the Fourth Celestial Sphere is like the animal soul which is in the heart. All parts of the body receive life from it. It is the well-known \u2018Visited House\u2019 of the shari`ah , the Fourth Heaven, and it is by it that Allah makes an oath in the verse: \"By the Mountain and inscribed Book on a fine outstretched parchment and the Visited House and elevated canopy and the overflowing sea.\" Qur'an, 52:1\u20116 The \u2018mountain\u2019 represents the Throne, and the \u2018inscribed Book\u2019 represents the Universal Soul which is the heart of the universe. The \u2018fine outstretched parchment\u2019 represents the Eighth Celestial Sphere, which is its manifestation. The \u2018elevated canopy\u2019 may be the Throne or it may represent the earthly sky. The \u2018Visited House\u2019 may represent the Fourth Celestial Sphere and it may represent the Universal Soul. The \u2018overflowing sea\u2019 is filled with forms and may represent the Realm of the Barrier, or interspace or barrier ( barzakh ), which lies between the two worlds of the spiritual and physical, and is referred to as the shadow realm and is filled with the form of everything in creation. The Ka`bah represents the Universal Soul which is called the Supreme House of Allah; its appearance on the water is an allusion to the spiritual realms which originate from it before the physical realms. \"It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and His Throne was upon the water.\" Qur'an, 11:7 This could mean that before the creation of the physical heavens and earth the Throne was upon their two spiritual counterparts, reasoning and the self, if by the term \u2018Throne\u2019 we mean the spiritual Throne which is the Primal Reasoning. It is possible that the water is an allusion to the basic matter from which the universe was created. Furthermore, it is possible that this was before \u2018the splitting asunder\u2019 during the time of unity when all primordial matter was in one state, when reasoning, the soul, and the Throne were one Reality. The \u2018First House\u2019 which has been alluded to is the Universal Soul and the word \u2018Bakkah\u2019, is an allusion to the Eighth Celestial Sphere, which is termed the Dais (kursiy) and as \u2018Blessed\u2019 \u2013 an allusion to the blessing of knowledge and truth which surround it and which descend from it to the rest of creation below it. \u2018A guidance for the world\u2019 is an allusion to its overflowing grace and illumination for all of the worlds. \u2018The station of Abraham\u2019 is an allusion to the arrival of the spiritual traveler, by means of it, to the station of the all\u2011inclusive oneness of the haqiqah of Abraham. Allah says the following concerning this: \"And in this way We show Abraham the dominion of the heavens and the earth so that he may be among the certain.\" Qur'an, 6:75 \"\u2026and whoever has entered it is secure.\" Qur'an, 3:97 These words indicate that whoever enters the House in the manner mentioned above will be secure from all suspicion and doubt regarding the cosmic Divine sanctity. He will be secure from the two forms of associating others with Allah, i.e. openly and secretly. \"\u2026And Allah has obliged the people to make the Pilgrimage to the House\u2026\" Qur'an, 3:97 That is to say, from the standpoint of spiritual knowledge, of witnessing, unveiling, and viewing an obligation rests upon the people who are ready for this station to go to that House in this manner. The verse \"\u2026whoever is able to make his way to it,\" Qur'an, 3:97 is an indication of His having distinguished a particular group of people who are able to do it by virtue of their appropriate knowledge and good action. Useful knowledge is attained in two ways. Either directly from Allah without any human intermediary, referred to as revelation, inspiration and unveiling, or through the medium of the men of knowledge, like His Prophets and Messengers. They are alluded to in: \"Read: And your Lord is the Most Generous, He who taught with the pen,\" Qur'an, 96:3\u20114 and: \"\u2026and when Allah made a covenant with those who were given the Book: You shall certainly make it known to men and you shall not hide it. And they cast it behind their backs and took a small price for it; so wretched is that which they have purchased.\" Qur'an, 3:187 Good actions also have two aspects: One relates to the people of shari`ah and tariqah, and refers to good and purifying actions, with no trace of doubt or suspicion and which is performed purely and sincerely for Allah. The other aspect is distinctly for the people of haqiqah and the people of attainment, and this is not known or witnessed by anyone in existence except by Allah: \"So whoever wants to meet his Lord, let him perform a good action and not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord.\" Qur'an, 18:110","title":"The Pilgrimage of the Gnostic"},{"location":"guides/pilgrimage/#stations-of-the-self","text":"Thus, whoever desires to go on the Pilgrimage of the gnostics must assume the state of ihr\u0101m from witnessing the realms of the senses completely, by forbidding (i.e. making har\u0101m) his self from witnessing the physical universe and those worldly pleasures which are connected with it. Then he should direct his attention to the spiritual realm, which is the Sanctuary, Makkah or Bakkah, so that in fact he may attain it and become adorned with the Attributes of this spiritual realm and obtain its knowledge. Then he should direct his attention to the Ka`bah of Haqiqah, which is the Universal Soul and its knowledge and truths, and make seven taw\u0101fs around it. The seven stations of the self are: The Commanding Self ( nafs al\u2011amm\u0101rah ) The Critical Self ( nafs al\u2011laww\u0101mah ) The Inspirational Self ( nafs al\u2011mulhamah ) The Tranquil Self ( nafs al\u2011mutma\u2019innah ) The Contented Self ( nafs al\u2011radiyah ) The Self which is the object of Allah\u2019s contentment ( nafs al\u2011mardiyah ) The Perfected Self ( nafs al\u2011k\u0101milah ) The levels of knowledge of the physical realm correspond to what has been called the \u2018Seven Levels of Qur\u2019anic Knowledge\u2019, of which there are numerous subdivisions, and have been indicated by the Prophet when he said: \"Indeed the Qur\u2019an possesses both an outward and an inward and its inward possesses an inward continuing to seven levels.\" Then the attention is turned to the station of Abraham, which is the station of Unity, and the Presence of Oneness, known as the Primal Reasoning and the Supreme Soul. There he performs a prayer of two rak`\u0101t in thanksgiving for having arrived at that Presence. The two rak`\u0101t represent the annihilation from both the outer and the inner realms and whatever they contain of existence and creation, including himself. Then he hastens between Safa and Marwa (outer and inner worlds), to observe them once again with his effort and struggle in order to discontinue looking upon multiplicity by carefully examining the One Existence which lies behind it, and to become firmly established in the station of unity or gatheredness, which is his desired destination. Then he directs his attention to the Ka`bah once again in order to witness the Universal Soul and to observe its truths. He takes the ihr\u0101m of the Pilgrimage from it, which is beyond rationality, in the prescribed manner. Then he turns his attention to `Arafat (the station of the self). Turning one\u2019s attention to the `Arafat of the self is to turn the attention to the station of knowledge of haqiqah and there is no Presence after this Presence except the presence of the Essence, which no one can reach, for it has preceded and reached all before creation. In this station the arrival at the Unity of true gatheredness is attained, which is referred to as \u2018Muhammadi Unity\u2019. It is here that a man becomes a human ( ins\u0101n ) where the perfected being is perfected, and where the Master becomes a Master. For this reason they are obliged to return to the task of bringing others to perfection by returning to the realm of multiplicity, as Allah has said: \"\u2026and to warn their people when they return to them.\" Qur'an 9:122 When Shaykh Junayd was asked about the end destination, he replied: \"(It is) the return to the starting point.\" This is the secret of the return of the pilgrim from `Arafat to Mina, because it symbolizes the return to the realm of multiplicity. Then he occupies himself with the performance of the rituals of Mina, that is, the business of the outward world viz. the stoning, the sacrifice and the shaving of the head. He casts the stone of `Aqabah, which represents the world and its provision, casting it away without the possibility of returning, now that he lives the life of haqiqah (the real life): \"Do not reckon that those who have been killed in the way of Allah are dead; on the contrary, they are alive sustained with their Lord.\" Qur'an, 3:169 And: \"\u2026or is the one who has been dead and to whom We have restored life and made a light for him with which he walks among the people like the one who is within darkness from which he does not escape?\" Qur'an, 6:122 He then shaves his head, that is, he cuts the head of his self from the love of the world and its provision, thereby symbolizing that he will never allow his self to return again. Then he returns to the station of eternity, which is the ongoingness after annihilation, and he goes around the Ka`bah again in order to examine it once more from seven aspects in accordance with the state of his own creation, which is in seven stages; as Allah has said: \"\u2026He created you in stages\" Qur'an, 71:14 so that he may glimpse or experience the light of truth by way of that free movement within the seven regions of the earth and the seven celestial regions, which are referred to as Spiritual Regions and the Realm of Power respectively. Then he performs sal\u0101t at the station of Abraham, the Unity of Haqiqah, performing the two rak`\u0101t prayer of the Feast (Feast of the Sacrifice and Feast of the Fast Breaking), because of having become annihilated from every feast and because of his remaining eternally in a constant state of feasting in divine light, in the station of the Unity of Haqiqah. Finally he returns to Mina, to the world of multiplicity and the three stages which are mineral, plant and animal and stays there for three days of the Days of Allah, as Allah says: \"\u2026today I have completed for you your way of life (Islam) and I have perfected My Grace upon you and I am contented with Islam as a way of life for you.\" Qur'an, 5:3","title":"Stations of the Self"},{"location":"poetry/","text":"Poetry What Is It?

Don\u2019t step on the ants for you may kill one, and if you kill one you kill all. When you cut a tree you are on trial.

Then the birds will disappear, the sky will thunder and the countryside be set alight: to rejuvenate, to remind, to mend, to pour out love, interspersed with thunderclaps and lightning to ignite, to prepare for the birds of paradise, to perch and drink on the evergreen tree free of blight.
