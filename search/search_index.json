Karbala is an oasis near the Euphrates and, as a child, it seemed to me that my family had been there forever. I grew up in a most pleasant home environment with a seasonal flow of visitors, including many who were on their way to Mecca. The comfort and ease of life in Karbala was such that I had no inclination to leave my home for further studies, but destiny always prevails. Travelling to the U.K. for university was a great cultural shock, though one inevitably adjusts to changing circumstances. I enjoyed my professional life in the oil industry until I was challenged to discover essential meaning. With appropriate evaluation and self awareness I could easily see through the fallacy of contentment with outer wealth and security. This subconscious questioning was brought to the surface by meeting people from different cultures, who had pursued self discovery and awakening to the Real. I was fortunate to have witnessed that the same tradition and quest had existed within Muslim communities, but they had to leave the mainstream of organised religion under the disguise of Sufis and other quietist movements. My interest in what is real and eternal grew from my early thirties until I was completely caught in that obsession. I now know there is one universal, eternal and infinite Truth, which has been referred to by numerous religions and cultures throughout the ages by different names. Human discord, enmity and warfare are expressions of discontentment, anger and unhappiness and are due to the lower self, which is the shadow of the divine soul. You can only be durably at peace within yourself if you know you are in reality an eternal soul and the self is its earthly shadow. Our website tries to share this Truth. To accept natural human limitations and boundaries is the first step towards awareness of the boundless within us\u2014our soul or spirit.","title":"About"},{"location":"contact/","text":"For centuries human beings have clearly been pursuing a way of life that enables individuals and communities to be content, happy and celebrate quality of life.

Our median position gives us the advantage of witnessing Reality in its fullness. Consciousness and life began with the beginning of Creation, as far as we can tell. It\u2019s only in the last few thousand years or so that human beings have become more aware of awareness. We have evolved considerably in terms of our intelligence and reflectiveness and, as a result of this, we now can say that we are increasingly conscious of the dualities we each experience. There is very basic, day-to-day, \u201cnormal\u201d consciousness, which has to do with survival, growth, well-being, health and balance. This is limited by, and exists within, space and time. However, this consciousness emanates from Supreme, or Pure, Consciousness, which is beyond the mind\u2019s comprehension. Each one of us contains both the \u201cparticle\u201d of a personal identity - the so-called I - that is given life and consciousness by the \u201cwave\u201d: which is cosmic and beyond any limitation. My duty as a human being is towards myself. I have to recognise that I must respond to limited consciousness - to pain, danger, well-being or any physical, mental or emotional state which arises. However, I equally need to be in touch and calibrate constantly with the infinite state of Light or Consciousness in my own soul. I have a duty towards myself to see the Oneness behind dualities. The good and the bad; the up and the down; the temporary and the long-lasting: all of these dualities emanate from and return to unity. So, my first duty is to put all these into the proper perspective. Anything that has come will also go; any pain will also vanish; any need will also end, either by satisfaction or disappointment. I have to see the One source from which all dualities emanate, to which it is also their destiny to return. This is a most fundamental issue in life. The second most important duty I have is to realise that I am looking, longing, hoping, and praying for the best destiny. Life has moved, over millions of years, from being based on fear to now desiring hope. But what is it that I hope for? The destiny I am leading towards is that of Pure, Supreme, Soul or Spirit Consciousness. Once I know that life is actually not mine, but is eternal, perpetual and boundless and that my life is not separate from that life, then I begin to see glimpses of the Truth: that my soul is eternal. It will not die with the death of the body and the mind. This is the hope we are looking for. This is the most perfect, delightful destiny that we can hope to experience. It can be experienced while still alive. If not, everyone will experience it after death. The only difference is that, after death, your soul may be encumbered by the miseries you have carried through your life. These have to be sorted out, which is the meaning of hell and heaven. If you have cleared your accounts here and now, then you slip straight into the next zone of consciousness after leaving the encumbrance of the body and mind behind. These are the two issues: This life is experienced through dualities. Life itself is the eternal Light of Oneness, which is within every heart provided you can get to that heart without all the mess we accumulate in our short lives. The challenge of life is to learn and read the maps of dualities and how all opposites balance and neutralize each other. What is real is original Oneness\u2014Ever perfect.","title":"Hope and Duty"},{"location":"infinite-eternal/","text":"The soul is beyond any changes that the self experiences. To live as a soul in the moment leads to experiencing the pure thrill of life. All souls have emerged from a zone of consciousness or reality which is infinite and eternal. We each carry a deep memory of this, which drives all human beings to return. Wealth, power, knowledge, safety, security and all other desirable states emanate from that zone. To realise boundlessness and timelessness, the earthly transit experience is a necessary prelude. Our life on earth provides us with the experiences of the physical motherly womb and the boundaries and limitations of space and time. Our real duty and responsibility is to practice transcending all limitations so that we may return to our boundless origin in preparation for the hereafter where the natural, physical barriers and limits of the body and space are gone. The most common human concern, both personal and collective, is to have a good future and destiny. We ought to be prepared for, and familiar with, that final state. For most people, death is a sad and regretful event, but for those on the path of awakening it is the ultimate celebration and a welcome opening to the boundlessness of your own soul. Your present life is a brief prelude to experiencing perpetual life after death. We are all driven to experience goodness at every moment and that implies witnessing perfection. Often there are two levels of perfection, one is when the desired outcome is achieved and the other is intrinsic perfection: nothing ever occurs unless it declares perfection, even though we describe that state as chaotic or imperfect. Look at it dispassionately and you will be in awe. It is unavoidable to develop and evolve with skills and abilities which lead to a personal identity and individuality. However, Reality encompasses all the known and unknown states of consciousness. To rise or expand into more subtle levels of awareness, it is necessary to transcend identity and individuality. Locality is a mere sample of universality. The micro and the macro are inseparable and Oneness is an aspect of wholeness and total connectedness. Superficially, we distinguish between the observer and observed. In reality, they are part of the same One. All experience reflects cosmic reality through the process of participative emergence. God's light governs the cosmos and an aspect of it is the cause of the soul. Rather than pretending to be a godling, give in totally to the flow of that governance. The way out is the way in and that means do your best and trust in the rest. The light of supreme consciousness declares itself as the reason.","title":"Infinite and Eternal"},{"location":"articles/","text":"Articles Higher consciousness always drives us to connect and continue until we touch the source of Oneness and all connection.

I have to have correct conduct. I am accountable to me. As human beings, we live in numerous levels of duality. Up and down; breathe in, breathe out. As long as there is a mind, you are constantly choosing between good and bad, appropriate and inappropriate, healthy and diseased. It is context that matters most. Is it good if you see someone kicking a child out of the way? On the face of it, this seems terrible, but from another perspective this person might just have saved the child from an oncoming car. You have to read the context. That\u2019s why there is nothing accurate, no matter what. Even our sciences prove this: we cannot know completely the position and the movement of anything. Any incident - especially if it is a shocking one - is never observed in completely the same manner by all the people present. If there are thirty witnesses, there will be thirty different versions. These versions connect and correlate, but not entirely. We each look at any situation from our own perspective and make our own value judgements. Yet, these various evaluations arise from a single event. Duality and multiplicity is the nature of the gymnasium in which we are exercising our consciousness. We will never rest assured, we will never be content, we will never be at peace until we transcend duality. That\u2019s why people love sleep, drink, drugs and sex: all of these things are tiny little doors into a zone of consciousness that is not subject to duality. And that zone of consciousness is written for all of us. People who are on the \u201cspiritual path\u201d call it enlightenment, awakening, self-realisation and dozens of other titles. All these suggest is that there is no longer any confusion between twos: it is the zone of Oneness. If you have a scientific bent, you can call it the \u201cquantum field\u201d. If you\u2019re otherwise inclined, you can call it \u201cGod\u2019s zone\u201d. Everybody will experience it after death! As a younger person, I was eager to wake up right now. I thought, \u201cIf I don\u2019t wake up now it will be too late\u201d. But it will never be too late. Everybody will wake up. There is no rush. I was truly relieved once I knew that everybody will leave the conditioned consciousness of this womb and move into supreme, infinite, boundless consciousness after they die. Once the barrier of the body and the mind is removed only the truth remains - no differentiation. No longer is it a question of whether it is a particle or a wave function: it is energy fields ad infinitum. This is the whole story. If I practice this now, then I will not go back and forth with regrets and sorrow and guilt. Everybody feels guilty from time to time, and nobody wants to feel guilty, so why do it? Guilt arises because you don\u2019t have the calibration at the moment when you did whatever made you feel guilty. That calibration is called \u201cpresence\u201d, meaning that your mind and heart are fused together: head, which is reason and rationality, with heart, which is the home of your soul or spirit, or simply your awareness of unity. If the balance is there, you don\u2019t have any regrets. You would do the same thing in a year's time, because you were present. You were in the touch of timelessness. So you are not suddenly caught unawares, without your head and heart in unison. If the two are together, you won\u2019t need to remember what you said or did, because you will say the same, or a similar thing, in a slightly different context on a slightly different day. Go back to zero - the One is always already there.","title":"Arc of Life"},{"location":"articles/balance/","text":"The Balance Our world is out of balance in that earthly consciousness is excessively emphasized leading to a culture of fear and distraction, which hampers any attempt to integrate self and soul and thereby awaken to truth.

Many of the following excerpts are taken from the book \" Spectrum of Reality \". Consciousness Life is discerned via consciousness. Human consciousness spans a very wide spectrum of experiencing and understanding of realities. Consciousness may be defined as an energy field or light that generates other subtle forces such as intelligence, knowledge, understanding, feeling, emotion and other mental and spiritual states. Like colours that emanate from visible light, consciousness produces many discernible qualities such as love, generosity and other attributes, both high and low. We are conscious of the positive effect of kindness and empathy and shun enmity and discordance; we prefer connection. It is in human nature to have a clear and sharp mind and to understand and relate to what is happening around us. We are driven towards stability, balance and peace and to connect our inner world, of body and mind, to the outer world. We receive and transmit signals, signs and other complex visible or subtle linguistic expressions. We continuously seek self-sustained joy and goodness. We quest for eternal life, beyond our personal, conditioned and limited life.The biography of consciousness begins with basic life within the tidal pools of lakes and oceans. The simple chemistry of earth, water and sun was energized alchemically and gave the first cells their life - the birth of consciousness. We are driven to experience connectedness and continuity in what gives us stability, pleasure or happiness. The dynamics of human nature are based on the interplay between the eternal soul within us and its shadow companion, the lower self. Initially we think we are in charge and can choose our own intentions or actions. The fortunate few realize that what was in charge throughout was a holographic representation of supreme reality \u2013 the cosmic soul \u2013 the soul within the heart. Why? Every why is an attempt to connect. Why do we love light? It connects us with the surrounding area and enables us to move and act more efficiently. Why do we love? In order to connect more deeply. Why do you want to hear someone's voice or meet him or her? Why do you want to connect? In order to widen your knowledge and conscious experience. Why do you continue? Because the light of the soul within you is eternal. Every why comes back to one of three roots: to increase consciousness , through connectedness , and continuity . The whys will eventually lead to the domain of Oneness. It is the divine trick to reveal itself - eternally present but veiled. A question is the mental excuse needed to receive the gift of the answer that was already begging the question. Who Is In Control? As long as anything moves, its destiny and existence are uncertain. Nature provided a suitable environment for life and consciousness to emerge within the confines of the womb of space and time - that is the history of life on earth. However that limited cosnciousness is charged by permanent consciousness, by sacred beingness. From this emerges a short-lived human life dependent always on eternal life. All is under Soul-control, but we are veiled by the ability to move and change. You can close the door or leave it open. You can leave this place or not. Speak or be silent. Limited, limited, limited. We are given a tiny opening to visualize the infinite, self-propelled universe, which is under perfect governance at all times. Human life is like a waiting room before we perceive the reality of perfect control, by One who permeates it all. Calibration Frustrations arise out of the disparity between our higher Soul consciousness and the shadow self. How can we refer and calibrate our perceived experience with the constancy of the soul? It is helpful to have a role model, and more helpful to have a trusted teacher who reflects higher consciousness. The zone of higher consciousness is infinite and beyond all descriptions like joy, bliss or happiness. A good example of how to move to higher consciousness is riding a bicycle. You are put on the saddle and somebody pushes you. After a while you learn to balance and you feel you can repeat it on your own. Similarly, you first need a map of Reality, and you then follow the path that may lead to your destination. Continuity We often experience disappointment. We also too often feel trapped, confused or lost. Why are we constantly faced with these challenges? This is due to the limitations of conditioned consciousness and ego. Between birth and death, we play roles in this shadow theatre of life, as we evolve towards our origin. However, while birth and death form another complimentary pair of opposites, something withis us knows that life continues forever. The Soul, or ruh , is not subject to space and time, nor beginnings and endings which exist within it. Determination and grace are required to awaken to your Soul. It is when you experience that ever-present Reality, you know that your old self was merely a shadow, of the Real. When you transcend your tyrannical or feral self, you perceive that its role was to cause that suffering and thereby act as a prelude for awakening. Your lower self leads you to your real self \u2013 the divine spirit within. Life on earth is a struggle because it is a realm of experience between limitations and limitless Reality. You need help and a guiding hand. You need a reference. You need Grace and perception of the sacred presence. Sleepwalkers The herd mentality, collective consciousness and love of tradition are common conditions of most people. Old cultures and ingrained bonds, including religion, language and life habits, are barriers to change. So are self-concern and the obsession with survival. This renders most people tunnel-visioned, acting as sleepwalkers. Minds are occupied, bodies act like robots and hearts are dark. The people of Rome were surrounded by fire and most did not feel the urgency to evacuate. The unfortunate voyagers on the Titanic believed in the unsinkable ship and the orchestra continued playing. The love for continuity can override signals and signs of dangers. Sleepwalkers, like zombies, do not read signs or messages. No human being is spared from nature\u2019s generosity and from the shocks in life to wake us up to a higher level of consciousness and soul awareness. Dreams From ancient times the idea of what is real and what is not has challenged human thought. There are different zones of consciousness, as there are different realities. During our wakeful state, we consider most sharable experiences as real, but what is real about a dream? A healthy working relationship between our senses, mind and heart develop to reconcile the ever-changing evolving self and the constant soul. We link physics and metaphysics, our sensory reality and Reality. Dreams and sleep are essential for human health \u2013 to reorder, fit and connect day-to-day experiences and past memory, and enable our temporary life to be nourished by the soul\u2019s light. The enlightened being regards all normal experiences as a dream. Common dreams are merely dreams within a dream. The Aware Heart All human endeavours that increase knowledge, ability, efficiency and wholseomeness imply a journey towards higher consciousness. Life begins with basic sentiency and ends with spontaneous awareness of awareness. The arrow of time moves from 'no-thingness' towards absolute Oneness. Worship can be regarded as an evolutionary spiritual exercise to transcend the mind and come into unison with the divine soul within.

The Nature of Existence The Universe emerged from a mysterious singularity which is incomprehensible to us.

With the emergence of space and time, every type of form and energy emerged in pairs and pluralities. Whatever we discern has its complementary opposite, inseparable from it.

Many of the following excerpts are taken from the book \" Spectrum of Reality \".","title":"Consciousness - An Overview"},{"location":"articles/consciousness/#consciousness","text":"Life is discerned via consciousness. Human consciousness spans a very wide spectrum of experiencing and understanding of realities. Consciousness may be defined as an energy field or light that generates other subtle forces such as intelligence, knowledge, understanding, feeling, emotion and other mental and spiritual states. Like colours that emanate from visible light, consciousness produces many discernible qualities such as love, generosity and other attributes, both high and low. We are conscious of the positive effect of kindness and empathy and shun enmity and discordance; we prefer connection. It is in human nature to have a clear and sharp mind and to understand and relate to what is happening around us. We are driven towards stability, balance and peace and to connect our inner world, of body and mind, to the outer world. We receive and transmit signals, signs and other complex visible or subtle linguistic expressions. We continuously seek self-sustained joy and goodness. We quest for eternal life, beyond our personal, conditioned and limited life.The biography of consciousness begins with basic life within the tidal pools of lakes and oceans. The simple chemistry of earth, water and sun was energized alchemically and gave the first cells their life - the birth of consciousness. We are driven to experience connectedness and continuity in what gives us stability, pleasure or happiness. The dynamics of human nature are based on the interplay between the eternal soul within us and its shadow companion, the lower self. Initially we think we are in charge and can choose our own intentions or actions. The fortunate few realize that what was in charge throughout was a holographic representation of supreme reality \u2013 the cosmic soul \u2013 the soul within the heart.","title":"Consciousness"},{"location":"articles/consciousness/#why","text":"Every why is an attempt to connect. Why do we love light? It connects us with the surrounding area and enables us to move and act more efficiently. Why do we love? In order to connect more deeply. Why do you want to hear someone's voice or meet him or her? Why do you want to connect? In order to widen your knowledge and conscious experience. Why do you continue? Because the light of the soul within you is eternal. Every why comes back to one of three roots: to increase consciousness , through connectedness , and continuity . The whys will eventually lead to the domain of Oneness. It is the divine trick to reveal itself - eternally present but veiled. A question is the mental excuse needed to receive the gift of the answer that was already begging the question.","title":"Why?"},{"location":"articles/consciousness/#who-is-in-control","text":"As long as anything moves, its destiny and existence are uncertain. Nature provided a suitable environment for life and consciousness to emerge within the confines of the womb of space and time - that is the history of life on earth. However that limited cosnciousness is charged by permanent consciousness, by sacred beingness. From this emerges a short-lived human life dependent always on eternal life. All is under Soul-control, but we are veiled by the ability to move and change. You can close the door or leave it open. You can leave this place or not. Speak or be silent. Limited, limited, limited. We are given a tiny opening to visualize the infinite, self-propelled universe, which is under perfect governance at all times. Human life is like a waiting room before we perceive the reality of perfect control, by One who permeates it all.","title":"Who Is In Control?"},{"location":"articles/consciousness/#calibration","text":"Frustrations arise out of the disparity between our higher Soul consciousness and the shadow self. How can we refer and calibrate our perceived experience with the constancy of the soul? It is helpful to have a role model, and more helpful to have a trusted teacher who reflects higher consciousness. The zone of higher consciousness is infinite and beyond all descriptions like joy, bliss or happiness. A good example of how to move to higher consciousness is riding a bicycle. You are put on the saddle and somebody pushes you. After a while you learn to balance and you feel you can repeat it on your own. Similarly, you first need a map of Reality, and you then follow the path that may lead to your destination.","title":"Calibration"},{"location":"articles/consciousness/#continuity","text":"We often experience disappointment.

Our breathing, heartbeats, sleeping and waking, and the numerous mental functions, are all cyclical events drifting within space and time. A natural extension of all these experiences is the desire to know the nature of the ultimate end, and what lies beyond it. The soul carries the memory of cosmic patterns that we experience and we quest after that knowledge. We are driven to discover the original state \u2014 the sacred Oneness that is ever there. Sleep puts an end to our wakeful state and transcendence of mind takes us to the doorway of the infinite, eternal Light. One state ends for the other to begin. New Beginnings We live in constant struggle. We think, plan and hope that tomorrow will be better than today. Yet life itself flows according to its perfect path. The future is only a continuation of Now, and if, right now, we have presence of mind and heart, then there is no doubt that the future will be the best of all possibles ones. We are habituated to change for the better and renew our habits and patterns for what is considered optimal. Our world of dualities has originated from unity and is returning to that state. If any renewal is along the path of connectedness, continuation and Oneness, then it leads towards greater well-being. Whoever wants the best in their future needs to experience the best Now. We all know that the zone of joy and goodness exists right now, but we may not have tapped into it because we are concerned by shadows and illusions. The path, therefore, has to do with stopping those concerns and starting from a clean and neutral position. Then you may flow along the beam of light of your soul, witnessing perfections irrespective of outer appearances or feelings. Divine perfections, ever-present. Duty and Responsibility Feelings of duty, conscience, loyalty, and honesty all drive us towards higher consciousness and the zone of boundlessness after having been in the confinement of the space and time womb on earth. All the desirable attributes of goodness, generosity, kindness, and patience indicate a rise in consciousness from being local to universal, from being a mind to being a soul. Like being under several covers within the mother's womb, temporary reality, conditioned consciousness and the earthly creature mentality are a prelude towards the boundlessness of origin, which is the soul within. Higher consciousness is also veiled by necessary covers. The most prominent is the imaginal, which enables the cosmic soul to accept the confines of space and time. Pleasure and Happiness From the book \" Keys to the Qur'an Volume 4 \u2013 Commentary on Surat Ankabut, Al-Rahman, Al-Waqi`ah and Al-Mulk \" A pleasure is something one can share, one can buy. It is related to attachment and is a worldly thing while surur , joy, is for its own sake. The bird sings because its nature is to sing, irrespective of whether the hunter is hunting it or the neighborhood is giving it extra food. A pleasure is a result of something that has occurred. A person is lonely, then he meets a companion who echoes much of what he believes in \u2013 that is a pleasure. Someone was hungry, there was emptiness in his stomach and it was filled with food \u2013 that is a pleasure. Pleasure is like neutralization: the negative and the positive meet and are neutralized. Joy is something else; it is the negation of the negative. Joy occurs when what was considered to be desirable has been recognized as being wahm , illusion. Negation of the negative is positive and that is the normal state of man. It is for this reason that man inherently seeks joy. He knows pleasure, he knows it is purchasable, but he does not readily know the way to joy. Man seeks happiness because it is his real nature. He is unhappy because he has been telling himself that he needs a certain something to be happy. He constantly runs after it, but as soon as he gets it, he desires something else. The door to the abode of joy is the recognition of how to unknot what one has knotted. That is why it is said that the source is a secret within a secret. A desirable thing is in itself a wahm . The recognition of the wahm is the negation of it. And if the negation is genuine, then the root of joy is being nourished from within. That is the soil in which the tree of contentment will grow. Contentment is a tree that nobody can transplant into anybody else. One has to, through one\u2019s own labor, nurture it and make it grow. \u2018You\u2019 Are The Outer And The Inner From the book \u201c Calling Allah By His Most Beautiful Names \u201d We can talk of three realms of unity, which relate to the zones of action, attribute and essence. Action and manifestation are based on causality, reasoning and intellect. The reflective believer will soon discover that all experiences are balanced by their opposites. There is no pleasure without displeasure, no health without illness, and the root of these realities lies in their opposite. Higher attributes reflect the divine qualities and are most desirable for us as they are doors to inner happiness. Essence is the indiscernible and hidden root \u2013 the Light of lights. When one is illumined, the state of excellence ( ihs\u0101n ) is experienced and tasted. Then the All-Merciful appears and you will see His light in every situation. As life in our discernible world is based on action, it means we live with constant change; hence we are always seeking a reliable zone of reference so that we can understand change and deal with it with a sense of priority. We may desire a beautiful object, for example, but it can deteriorate and become ugly in time or under certain circumstances. Thus, what we really desire is the attribute of beauty, and not the object itself. The realm of attributes is subtler than that of the realm of action and manifestation. Even subtler is the essence of Allah which is hidden in His attributes, which themselves are behind the actions and manifestations of physical existence. Therefore, witnessing and understanding the unity of action and manifestation comes before realising the unity of attributes, all of which meet in the one essence. The Prophet (pbuh) said: \u201cI take refuge in Your forgiveness from Your punishment [unity of actions] and I take refuge in Your mercy from Your anger [unity of attributes] and I take refuge in You from You [unity of essence] Oh Lord, do not let me rely upon myself, not even for a blink of an eye.\u201d Its meaning is that there is only \u2018You\u2019 behind all that appears, and within all that there is. \u2018You\u2019 are the outer and the inner.","title":"The Cycles of Life and Reality"},{"location":"articles/cycles-life-reality/#cycles-of-life-and-reality","text":"We experience numerous spheres of cycles and zones of consciousness with natural beginnings and ends.

Decrees are the rules which define life\u2019s experiences on earth. Most of these rules are describable or measurable, especially those dealing with the visible realities. The rules that govern all aspects of physical (visible and experiential) existence combine with those that control the unseen forces to form a network that will result in, for example, the laws of physics. We can describe the phenomenon of light, for instance, as both a wave and a particle called a photon. The rules somehow emerge from an unknown domain into describable, measurable, physical laws. So the decrees can be seen as a series of multitudinous models by means of which the creation, seen and unseen, is held together. Destiny is the final occurrence that is experienced by the individual through the passage of time, when these laws are enacted. It is when a describable event has already passed through time. The concept of destiny is also parallel in Arabic to another term \u2019ajal , which signifies \u2018appointed time, date, deadline, instant of death, respite, delay\u2019. If we say a business partnership has an \u2018ajal of five years, it means that at the end of this period it will have reached its full destiny, which is dissolution. The final destiny of every man is his awakening to his permanent, non-time reality, from which he has emerged. We are given the experience of this life, with all its decrees, for us to know them, accept them and become one with them so that we can see our destiny within them, and our destiny beyond them, when time stops at the point of death. Through the discipline of meditative practices, time can be experienced as coming to a stop. Whilst we fear death we love and are dependent on deep sleep, which is the nearest experience to death. If we are able to experience the mini-death of inner contemplation, we stand a good chance of realizing that our true reality, the Source of the cause behind existence, is eternal and ever present. It is only the body that dies, while the soul or spirit continues into perpetuity. As we are all programmed to dislike fear, the universal fear of death betrays the true meaning of death. It is only an experiential barrier that demarcates a natural discrimination by returning the body to where it belongs, and by returning the soul to whence it originally emanated from in the zone of eternal consciousness. So the fact that we do not like death reveals a certain measure of its falsehood as a termination of life. It is in fact a process of segregation. The confusion is due to identifying with the body and mind rather than the soul within. It is only the body that dies; for it has been the vehicle for the development of the self, whose proper schooling lies in the melting pot of the world of duality, whilst yearning for the knowledge of the One from whom it emanated in the first place. The human destiny is potentially the highest of known creations \u2013 as was our beginning. We start life with a basic level of existence and are driven to reach the highest levels of consciousness and experiences. Enlightenment is to know the perfection and reliability of God\u2019s plan; with reflection and wisdom we realize that human will is a very small factor in contentment and sustained happiness. Spiritual wisdom leads to witnessing the utter perfection of the instant and abandonment to the moment. Then we come to understand the truth that abundance is available at all times to everyone. This is the final awakening to the state of Oneness. We are brought into time in order that we may face the incredible, unfathomable, never-ending non-time.

I would like to share with you the origin of this Eid celebration. We love to celebrate, to be in a state of positive expectation, to be generous, intelligent and courageous. So we celebrate the Eid in order for us to return to the original condition of Adam in the Garden. This state of consciousness is within our soul and needs to be recalled by transcending our earth bound identity. Life on this Earth is a prelude to a return to the Garden from where Adam, Hawa and all of us \u2013 as children of Adam \u2013 came from. On earth we are constantly challenged with dualities and choices. We seek the best continuously. This life of ours on earth is only a practice to return back to the Garden. This is why we love beautiful, tranquil, earthly gardens with water and flowers. Unlike these gardens, the original Garden is forever. It does not change. The Qur\u2019an mentions that for all those who are in cautious awareness and remembrance, paradise is close by. We move after this month of restriction back to normality. We only need to restrict a little of the outer in order to increase on the inner. The wonderful experiences during the month of fasting enable us to access a higher zone of consciousness and boundlessness. The word Eid appears only once in the Qur\u2019an, in Surah Ma\u00b4idah . It is the story of the sincere followers of the Prophet Isa. They ask him: \"Can\u2019t you bring upon us from the unseen a banquet or a meal, or some nourishment? We want to taste of it so that our hearts become completely certain that all of it is from Allah.\" So Isa asks his Lord to bring down a heavenly banquet \u2013 an Eid , not only for those who came first but also for those of later time. We always quest the proof of the connection between the seen and the unseen, as our soul is heavenly but living on earth. This is the meaning of Eid . The Arabic root is aada , \u2018to have returned\u2019. Return to what? All of us, who have fasted, tend to return once more towards over indulgence. This is not an interesting return. What is worthwhile to return to is the original condition of Adam in the Garden. We need to move towards that Eid . A day in which you are constantly aware of Allah\u2019s presence with you is an Eid . So every instant can be an Eid , meaning a return back to the original state that we aspire for. We are here to interact in this world without being overwhelmed by it. This knowledge is liberating. Our worldly existence is not a prison. It can be a path towards the ultimate liberated perfection. Space and time will no longer hold us down as happens in our normal consciousness. We want to do things fast and go beyond the speed of light. We want to do everything instantly, so that we are close to that state of constant, timeless perfection. This is our original nature. This is where we came from, and this is where we are all struggling to return to. Our path is based on grooming the self. Once you have realised that the lower self is of no consequence it can lead you to your higher self. The lower self is only an ego, ever changing, ever treacherous, and you can only recognise its shadows and darkness because of the divine light in you. You, then, recognize that you are often frightened, often greedy, that you are ignorant about what comes after death and are scared of it. Once you taste this knowledge you realise you are a soul. Every one of us desires the same thing. Beyond what we see as troubles and difficulties there is a most just Creator, whose order is within us. No matter the individual level of knowledge, education, spiritual understanding and awakening, we all have the same potential. All of us have a soul, which is a spark from the original sacred light of Allah. We all have a divine treasure in our heart.Once we realise that our source of inspiration and connection to Allah \u2013 our soul \u2013 lies within us, we can rise to the true original Adamic worshipfulness. Allah will guide everybody how best to worship. All we need to do is to stop our lower self. This is all what we can do. We have no control over the soul. So this is why it all begins with \"la ilaha illallah\" . Eid is about arrival. It is about returning to where we have emanated from, returning to the state that we yearn for. The little outer garden is a sample of the eternal Garden, whose pattern lies within our hearts.","title":"Eid - The Return"},{"location":"articles/eid/#eid-the-return","text":"May every instant of our lives be full of joyful optimism so that we progress from one level of understanding and inner light to a higher one, until such time there is nothing left for us to do in this world other than to remain in the ecstasy of truly saying, knowing, singing \"la ilaha illallah\" ! I would like to share with you the origin of this Eid celebration. We love to celebrate, to be in a state of positive expectation, to be generous, intelligent and courageous. So we celebrate the Eid in order for us to return to the original condition of Adam in the Garden. This state of consciousness is within our soul and needs to be recalled by transcending our earth bound identity. Life on this Earth is a prelude to a return to the Garden from where Adam, Hawa and all of us \u2013 as children of Adam \u2013 came from.

No matter what we look at in existence, we find that it can always be traced back to its one original source, Allah. Recognising the One Existent Creator while we live in this world of multiple forms is essential for our well-being. Without such a unitive recognition and awareness, we tend to fluctuate between being disturbed and tranquil. Like the pilgrimage to Makka, journey of transformation requires letting go all of one\u2019s assumptions. All links with the past must be cut, irrespective of culture and identity. We cannot deny that the past has happened; its benefits could continue to unfold in innumerable ways. However, if we succeed in letting go, of not making comparisons or clinging to what we imagine will give us happiness, our minds will be more alert to the moment. Our hearts will also be empty of negative feelings such as fear, greed and jealousy. Then we will be transformed. People often say that they find it hard to give up their attachments. Those who hang on to their material possessions, habits, and ideas must stop to think: what is it that they feel they have to give up? What promises were they given in the womb? Nothing belongs to us. We merely borrow certain minerals and other matter that constitute the body from the earth, in order for us to journey from the unseen, interact with creation, and to return to the unseen with the light of knowledge that Allah has provided for us. Created to reside for a short while in the darkness in the womb, we emerge, encompassed by the Light that enables us to see sunlight, as well as the darkness of numerous shadows. This is the path of discovery. Without embarking on this journey we have no hope of entering the city of knowledge that lies unconquered within us from before time. Transformation is possible if the prescription is correct and applied with care. Here we enter an altogether new state which, if maintained, leads to a station of being that encompasses and transcends our humanity. Allah says in the Qur\u2019an that He will not change people unless they change themselves. This applies to each individual and to society. Indeed, if we start by changing the individual, we will end up with a changed society. Only when we arrive at the true knowledge of our origin can we hope to serve society. Attempting to serve others before having arrived at such knowledge will only project our inner confusion onto others. If, however, we return to our original station of fusion, of being completely integrated in our knowledge of the outer and the inner, the seen and the unseen, then we may be of some use to the rest of mankind. Once we arrive at the real knowledge that is already contained within us, we find that we are constantly circling the inner Ka\u2019ba that symbolises the believer\u2019s heart, and which is seen to be the seat of all truth. This perpetual, spontaneous awareness puts us in a constant state of jih\u0101d (striving) and purifies our intentions. We learn to face ourselves with honesty and question whether we are serving others with expectation of reward or praise. Do we recognise that what we are giving to others, in terms of material wealth or a service, is from the very Source of giving, mercy and generosity? Or is it instead an act that will merely gratify our egos, based on enhancing our reputations or our society, or to impose the glitter of our knowledge on others? The ability to do this is a great blessing. It is a remarkable gift to be able to give to others what does not, in any case, belong to us. We only have it on loan from our Creator. If we make ourselves completely neutral by giving up the past and our attachments while keeping ourselves open to inspiration, coupled with willingness to undertake appropriate work, then we are true wayfarers on the path of unity. This is positive action. It is not the occurrence of some fantastic or miraculous event; the miracle is life itself. The prophet \u2018Isa (Jesus) came at a time when people were fascinated by healing and so Allah gave him the ultimate power of healing \u2013 that of raising the dead.

The time of Buddha was a time of only \u1e25aq\u012bqa, of light, but now we need boundaries to deal with the darkness of modernism, with its enslavement by monetarism. We cannot resurrect the past. We need instead to dig inside ourselves to discover the origin of human consciousness, the inner cosmos, and so discover the complete prophetic teaching \u2026 There is only one journey, and every prophet from Adam, through the hundreds whose names are not known, to Prophet Muhammad, bore the same message of Isl\u0101m, which means submission to this all-encompassing reality.

We may feel secure and content regarding an aspect of our life and yet at the same time apprehensive or insecure regarding something else. Even when one feels upbeat and happy there lurks a shade of sadness, due to the temporariness of this state. There is a subconscious fear of loss of the pleasurable moment as we have already experienced previous mood swings. No \u2018mental\u2019 state or feelings is ever lost. The swing between contentment and the desires continue. Normal day-to-day human life contains countless illusions partly sensed and partly imagined or anticipated. The so-called \u2018real\u2019 life experiences are a result of a combination of subjective and objective factors, which in fact include fears, fantasies and wishful thinking. The ever-changing state of personal consciousness is dependent upon pure consciousness that permeates all existence. This sphere of constancy and wholeness engulfs and energises all lesser levels of consciousness. Conditioned consciousness drives us to pursue whatever ensures survival, strength and growth and a host of other earthly needs. We naturally delude ourselves into pursuing extra desires and ideas superfluous to survival and basic stability. For example, love for wealth or power may relate to satisfying needs for physical survival and social status up to a point. Similarly body chemistry drives us towards sexual gratification and procreation but it often becomes a means to stimulate mental \u2018reward\u2019 chemistry. Through the power of hunger we are driven to act and know how and where to discover food and shelter. Ultimately, the drive to satisfy worldly needs leads to higher and subtler states of harmony and wellbeing at the levels of body, mind and heart. Spiritual wisdom is the realization that on its own the self/ego can never attain perfection or happiness. It is by transcending all illusions and so-called realities that we awaken to the ever-present Real. When the outer challenges lead to inner transformation, the joys of unity overflow beyond all that is seen and unseen. Natural Illusions. Nature can be deceptive in many ways and at different levels of subtlety or obviousness. Rainbow colours appear to reveal the vibrant components of light, yet there is a far boarder range of frequencies and wavelengths in light than we can visibly discern. The common assumption is that light is what enables us to see; the rest of the story eludes us. For example, birds have learned many ways to distract potential threats from their nests. Often the male bird acts as a decoy while the female lays still on the eggs, blending in with her surroundings; a trick which gives birds an advantage in order to survive. In fact, nature is full of deceptions and illusions. Consciousness is the foundation of life that connects the unseen with the seen through light. Without light there would be neither energy nor the physical world. Our apparent world hides numerous levels of subtler forces, which are barely discernible or describable. Logic and causality are keys in describing what appears to us as real, but what is not apparent is of much greater magnitude, like the bulk of the hidden iceberg. Consciousness is subtler than light and is at the root of existence and creation. There are countless ways of looking at consciousness and differentiating between its levels, spheres and spectrums. Two spheres stand out clearly, however. First is the basic level that makes human beings sentient and alive. This basic consciousness is the face behind the will to survive, grow, replicate, and so on. All living entities are energized by this consciousness. Human beings are distinct from other creatures due to a greater sphere of consciousness, which is higher consciousness, God-consciousness, supreme consciousness or soul consciousness. To this level belong all higher attributes and virtues such as mercy, generosity, forgiveness and others. Human ethics and morality evolve due to higher consciousness. To be like an animal at first is quite natural, but not to evolve and realize higher consciousness signifies an unfulfilled life. Every creation reaches its appropriate destiny when its highest potential (in terms of consciousness) is accomplished. God is the essence of universal supreme consciousness. For a child it is natural and normal to be selfish and concerned mostly with its own physical sensory needs. With maturity comes the quest for a sustainable fulfilled life. The lights of higher consciousness begin to supersede the early \u2018survival\u2019 consciousness. To remain mainly bound to conditioned consciousness is to be deprived of awakening to the one real potential of soul essence. Our animalistic state of existence reinforces itself through multiple delusions, veils and worldly distractions, which divert us from accessing soul-consciousness. If we look closely at all these paradoxes and illusions, we see that they were in fact appropriate for us at a particular time or situation in this world, like the shell that protects the kernel of a nut. That is why it is said that there is goodness in everything that exists \u2013 if only we look with the eye of spiritual discernment. It is context and specific causality that needs to be viewed. A poison can kill and can cure. Egotism is essential in a child but out of season in a grown up and even detrimental. Everything in nature reveals some aspects of itself and hides others.

To progress spiritually we need to witness naturally occurring illusions, assumptions and fallacies and break past them to the essence that is eternally constant and perfect.","title":"Natural Illusions."},{"location":"articles/parable-spider/","text":"The Parable of the Spider's House Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri from the book \u201cThe Mercy of Qur\u2019an and The Advent of Zaman Tafsir of Surat Ankabut, Rahman, Waqi\u00e1, Mulk\u201d \u201cThe parable of those who take guardians besides Allah is like the parable of the spider that spins for itself a house.

The spider\u2019s web is exposed to the elements of nature: heat, cold, wind and rain. In fact, the web does not protect the spider from anything, as its main function is to provide the spider with insects for food. It is the least secure, and the least stable, of structures. Any human being who believes he or she is stable, or secure materially or socially in terms of habits or habitat, is dwelling on as flimsy a premise as the spider\u2019s web. One\u2019s attachments, phobias and habits are as secure as the wisp of thought that repeatedly brings them about. The ultimate refuge is with Allah. Man takes refuge in Allah when he pursues the knowledge of Reality by realizing that everything other than Allah is relative and unsatisfactory, like the house of the spider. When the wind or rain comes, the web often breaks apart. By taking refuge in Allah, man leaves what is relative and insecure and orientates himself towards what he knows to be reliable and permanent. He migrates from ignorance to knowledge. The closer he comes to knowledge of Allah the more he discovers the relativity of everything else.

One who finds that he has become too attached to a place or situation will feel as though his heart has been stripped from him when that place or situation disappears.

We always hope to discover answers to our day-to-day questions as well as the big questions in life. How did life begin? How and when will life end? Who am I really? Who are you? What is the purpose of life? Philosophical people often answer that it is to know Truth or God. What is that? We are often told that we have duties and responsibilities in this life. What are these and what is their purpose? What is truth and where is it? What is real and constant? Will we ever know the truth in this life? Life, Death and Change Several religions say that everyone will know the truth after death. In that case, where is God\u2019s love and generosity in this world? At all times we seek to avoid pain, fear and sorrow, yet no one is ever spared these experiences in varying intensity and duration. We all want to live a fulfilled and happy life, yet we are unlikely to meet anyone who has successfully attained that state durably. Why do we experience ever-changing feelings and moods? Much of life\u2019s experiences can be pleasant and desirable yet there are numerous events that cause grief, pain and misery. How can we experience and enjoy the highest quality of life? How can we maintain a healthy balance in body, mind and heart? What is the purpose of religion and spiritual aspiration? Why is it that nothing ever gives us sustained contentment? What is it that we are really striving to achieve? What sort of life do we experience, if any, after death? Life on earth is due to the interplay between energy and matter within space and time. Basic life began a few hundred million years ago, giving rise to human consciousness as we experience it now. There are two sides to human nature. One has evolved over millions of years and contains traces of all that exists on earth. The other side of our composition is a celestial bundle of lights and energies often named as spirit or soul. This celestial life source is our real nature which we long for \u2013 the God within. The development of our personality and conditioned consciousness takes place in this dynamic of an animal self confined within space and time, and energised by the spirit. Religious practices are there to refine the animal self and enable it to be guided by the light, soul or spirit. Most world religions advocate respect for life and all living things, and for humans to exercise modesty, generosity and accountability in upholding higher values, ethics, virtuous conduct, selfless service to other beings and constant gratitude to God irrespective of outer circumstances. All of this is meaningful and possible to follow if you accept the premise that our journey on earth is to rise in consciousness from the lowest animal selfish tendencies to pure consciousness, cosmic governance, or divine prevalence. Islam highlights what so many earlier prophets and sages before Muhammad had emphasised and tried to inculcate in their people and cultures. Unity The crucial issue is the unitive nature of truth and reality or God as the source of life and all creation, and this cosmic source is also the final destiny. Everything has emanated from that essence and returns to it. The teachings of the Qur\u2019an and the way of Muhammad also highlight the purpose of human existence and its transient nature from the lower self to the divine soul itself, from birth to death, all of which is in preparation for the full unveiling of Truth after death \u2013 eternal cosmic connectedness. Death is a most natural transfer from dualities and confinement within space and time to eternal oneness. The Qur\u2019an reveals that real life is ever continuous and not subject to beginnings or ends, such as birth and death. We experience, in fact, two modes of birth and death. One birth is physical, biological and emotional, and the other one is awakening to the ultimate truth, which is the nature of our own soul. This spiritual birth is the essential drive within all human desires and hopes, the source of which can be accessed and touched upon through transcendence of all sensory experiences and conditioned consciousness. A preparation for this is meditation, contemplation, silence and solitude. The Qur\u2019an and prophetic teachings emphasise the duty and purpose of human beings, which is to transcend the lower self to the divine soul in preparation for ongoingness in the hereafter. Real education and grooming evolves us to act as accountable and responsible earthly stewards \u2013 the master is the divine soul. All our life experiences are practices towards higher infinite consciousness, and the many grades, scales, zones and domains that it encompasses. All of this will be experienced fully after a period of the rattling and shaking of purification after death, described by most world religions. The Abrahamic religions are clear about heaven, hell and purgatory. Others have similar teachings, including that of reincarnation \u2013 if you haven\u2019t succeeded in transcending to higher consciousness then you will return. All world religions have some notion that if you have not progressed sufficiently towards higher consciousness before death then there is going to be a \u2019decompression\u2019 so that whatever you have carried within yourself as traces and fantasies is eradicated. But if you have practiced eradication, like the Buddhist practice of death with its eight different stages, then it is a natural progression towards liberation from the illusion of separation. Practicing Surrender Islam, like some other world religions, prescribes practices that elevate consciousness through reflecting upon day-to-day habits, which are otherwise performed without full attention or reflection. The human purpose on earth is to ascend in consciousness from a very basic survival level to illumined awakening and arrival. When self-awareness becomes a natural constant habit, then every moment becomes enriched with vibrancy and delight. Religious practices and rituals are the beginnings of alignment between self and soul and transcending the material world to higher consciousness. Formally, you pray five times a day (which also has an important social aspect to it) until, as the Qur\u2019an describes, you are perpetually in that plugged-in state. The same applies to all other rituals. In a sense, you are at all times on pilgrimage. While with fasting, you are at all times aware of what you are putting in your mouth or what you are putting in your head. So let this month be different from other months, even if you cannot fast. Whatever you ingest, be aware of it, be more conscious of it. Marvel at how it is possible for you to lift your hand or even a finger. Enter the magic of this month so that all year round you will be aware of where you are sitting, why you are drinking, where you put your cup. Your whole life then becomes an act of worship. Life has to flow. It has to be fun and we all seek and hope for that. Initially with a child there is a little bribery and corruption \u2013 \u2018Do it for mummy\u2019s sake\u2019. But later on, by being in the dot of the now, by being present, you are already participating in the treasures of eternal life. If you are truly practicing silence and awareness of the moment and its immensity, then you know time and non-time; the eternal and the short, all lie in that moment. So you will know that the present moment, of which you are experiencing a little of its coming and its going, is perfect. You will know that the present moment contains within it eternity. You will know it is perfect. Bring that to the social level and you will never ever lament the difficulties of today \u2013 the bad culture, people don\u2019t listen, children are rebellious, etc. You must not regurgitate what you have been reiterating from the past. Read it. It will tell you. There is utter perfection in the moment; therefore, if you take today\u2019s time, you will recognise it is much better than ten years ago and much much better than a hundred years ago. This is a touchstone of contentment. The present moment contains all that happened in the past and gives a clear indication of what will happen in the future. By denying the perfection of the moment we will lack contentment and happiness will remain elusive. Divisions and differences between human beings are natural. So is our love for harmony and unity. Every one of us experiences constant change within space and time whilst we seek perspective and refer to higher consciousness with its boundless constancy. No two moments are the same for any living entity. Within each moment is the duality of what is attractive and what is not. Each and every living entity can act like a war machine with animosity and discord whilst wishing for peace and goodness, albeit in the distant future. How can we overcome enmity and discord, and accept differences in opinion, culture, or way of life, as natural occurrences just like the countless plants, flowers, flavors and colors? All humans are similar in many ways but also differ in other ways. No matter what we do, no matter what we say, every person and every people have a flavour. Reference to higher consciousness will put things in perspective and will show you the appropriate path. Lasting Contentment Peace and prosperity can only become durable when inner peace and contentment is attained when the self becomes subservient to the soul, thereby accessing timeless joy. Peace and prosperity become socially durable and universal when personal inner peace and contentment is attained by a number of people who have an influence over the community and society, and their guidance becomes a touchstone for normal conduct and behaviour. In the past, religious people, saints, sages and others were regarded as the ultimate reference points and arbiters when there were serious differences and disputes between people and communities. In our day-to-day life today we need the wisdom of perspective, durable goodness and true accountability regarding intentions and actions. The supreme treasure of all is the divine spirit within the heart, which is the ultimate guiding reference for fulfilled living. When a mature person is in constant attention, reflection and reference to the higher level of consciousness, then fulfillment is attained in the world of duality, change and uncertainty. This awakened being is constantly energised by permanent life and therefore regards death as a natural ascent to the liberated zone of eternal presence. Fears and sorrows become insignificant and the nature of death reveals itself to be a gift of liberation from the limitations of the earthly journey. Our limited world of dualities drives us to understand the cause and effect, origin and destiny, of all that exists in preparation for the state beyond death, beyond self-identity and the illusion of independence or separation from sacred oneness. Most of what we experience in nature is complementary and symbiotic and even where there appears to be divergence, nature acts to regulate the natural flow of diversities in life. With the human urge to investigate, study and discover the nature of material objects as well as feelings and emotions, we reach the conclusion that the entire of existence is differentiated sameness. No two moments are the same but the nature of time and space remains the same. If you simply live totally in the now then you are directly energised by higher eternal consciousness. Now is forever and so is the inner soul or spirit. So hasten with patience. Wait, especially if you are in a rush. Celebrate! It is human nature to be hopeful, cheerful and to celebrate goodness. Most people use any excuse to celebrate and leave behind sorrow, fear, or insecurity. We all love to celebrate \u2013 it is deep in the human psyche. Individually we celebrate within ourselves because that is our kingdom, and collectively with the wider kingdom. Celebration is victory, and victory is beyond success and failure. But we end up having pseudo-celebrations, like birthdays or the \u2018independence\u2019 of a country. We need to ask ourselves what is it that is worthy of celebration at all times and all occasions without any bitterness or regrets later on? Celebration is only going to be meaningful through Islam, Iman and Ihsan. Each is a zone of consciousness. Islam is that there is nothing in my hand; I didn\u2019t know who I was, I didn\u2019t know what was birth, I don\u2019t know what death is, so I have to surrender into the vast unknown. Iman is that I trust that it has been going on for millions of years so there must be some stability, some referencing, some governorship. That is Iman; I have faith, I have trust, I can rely upon the perfection that emerges from the unseen, whether experienced or not. Ihsan is that there is no \u2018me\u2019 anymore \u2013 there is only perfection; so if I am truly basking in that perfection I cannot but transmit that with which I have been saturated. Life is glorious and we celebrate it perpetually.","title":"Pointers to Truth"},{"location":"articles/pointers-to-truth/#pointers-to-truth","text":"Written by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri June 2018 Human needs, desires and questions never end.

The Path lies in dhikr , fikr and himmah . Dhikr is the remembrance of God, from whom I am separated by my self. It is this illusion that is caused by me that is the cause of this barrier, separation. So it is a process of elimination. If I overcome the self, if I remove all of these images, all of these goggles that I have erroneously put on, then I am bound to be less separated from that which is the source of all beingness. So remembrance is necessary for us to begin to dissolve the self. If I remember God at the moment of agitation and disappointment, if I remember the Creator of the entire cosmos, from Whom this life is allotted for a few years, then my own little misery, my own problem, put in the large perspective, is bound to gain a measure of relief. It is bound to be a remedy for whatever situation I am in. Remembrance begins as an outside activity. Then it belongs to the heart. How can I remember God when I am full of me? When the bucket is full of me, there is no room for anything else. It is a displacement process. A bucket of pure water with mud particles in suspension can be purified again if we place it under a tap which drips into it fresh clear water. In time, this bucket of mud begins to get cleaner and cleaner and begins to reflect more of its real nature of pure water. Our nature is that of purity. That is why we like purity \u2013 we are basically pure at source. So there is no room for personal guilt. Our heritage is purity and the simplicity of beingness. But, because of the activities which we undertake in the world, we begin to solidify the roles and images into a personality with apparently conflicting and often irreconcilable aspects. It is by remembrance of God that I can begin to melt down the layers that I have created which are the source of my agitation, problems, and expectations. It is the most vital activity. A muslim prays five times a day, five formal and definable times for dhikr and salat (prayer). Five times to remember and submit to Allah, outwardly and inwardly. Fikr is that light which is shed on a scene in order to discriminate: what is good and what is bad, what is lasting and what is not, right and wrong, black and white. If we are in a state of real remembrance, then discrimination will operate spontaneously. Suppose we stop the moving film of our actions and freeze a frame. Dhikr freezes the \u2018frame\u2019 of action and fikr shines the torch of discrimination on it. Subsequent correct action will result from this. The film shows that I disliked your presence here to such an extent that I proceeded to punch you, and all of a sudden I see myself in this childish act, in the frozen shot of this film. If I catch myself in that instant, I am bound to discriminate and immediately correct the course. But we are often slow, and leave it too late. After I have done it I plead for forgiveness and say, \u2018It wasn\u2019t me!\u2019 What this means is that, after the event, I have had a replay of the act, because it was fresh in my memory, and in the light of discrimination. Neither remembrance nor discrimination will occur unless there is himmah \u2013 energy, yearning to be true, full, alive. The more we have this energy, the more it becomes available. It is like tapping a source: the more you clean the head of the spring, the more clear water will flow. But because we are accustomed to living in a manner that is totally incorrect and harmful, and which we try to persevere, we are scared of change and shut ourselves up in our private rooms. It is because we want to preserve habits. We are afraid of opening our hands to drop the thorns which we have clasped and made ours. But, when the pain is deep and real, then great yearning will enable us to act, drop the thorns and find the freedom that was there to begin with anyway. You may ask, \u2018if it is so easy, then what are all these methods for?\u2019 In a way, it is like picking up new thorns at will in order to get rid of the thorn that has been aching in you all these years \u2013 the old self. So there must be a beginning. The extent of new speed of the raft, floating on the stream of the past, depends entirely on the extent of the new energy in you. The greater the yearning and burning, the greater the energy. The greater is your suffering, the more you are qualified to free yourself from it. When fear is mild, one can brush it aside. When it is vast, new basic treatment is necessary and final cure is more probable. So the three basic requirements of the Path are entirely interrelated. Each of them reinforces the others, both in quantity and quality. If I have greater awareness, then more discrimination will constantly illuminate my actions. Therefore, more of my new actions will be such that they are not likely to enhance the self in me. Slowly, one observes the vanishing \u2018I\u2019-ness: arrogance, vanity, personality. So the outcome of the path towards self-knowledge is getting rid of the impermanent. Get rid of the \u2018I\u2019 and you will see the real self. It is a process of elimination.

The Path lies in dhikr , fikr and himmah . Dhikr is the remembrance of God, from whom I am separated by my self. It is this illusion that is caused by me that is the cause of this barrier, separation. So it is a process of elimination. If I overcome the self, if I remove all of these images, all of these goggles that I have erroneously put on, then I am bound to be less separated from that which is the source of all beingness. So remembrance is necessary for us to begin to dissolve the self. If I remember God at the moment of agitation and disappointment, if I remember the Creator of the entire cosmos, from Whom this life is allotted for a few years, then my own little misery, my own problem, put in the large perspective, is bound to gain a measure of relief. It is bound to be a remedy for whatever situation I am in. Remembrance begins as an outside activity. Then it belongs to the heart. How can I remember God when I am full of me? When the bucket is full of me, there is no room for anything else. It is a displacement process. A bucket of pure water with mud particles in suspension can be purified again if we place it under a tap which drips into it fresh clear water. In time, this bucket of mud begins to get cleaner and cleaner and begins to reflect more of its real nature of pure water. Our nature is that of purity. That is why we like purity \u2013 we are basically pure at source. So there is no room for personal guilt. Our heritage is purity and the simplicity of beingness. But, because of the activities which we undertake in the world, we begin to solidify the roles and images into a personality with apparently conflicting and often irreconcilable aspects. It is by remembrance of God that I can begin to melt down the layers that I have created which are the source of my agitation, problems, and expectations. It is the most vital activity.

Like other seekers before and after him, he went to solitary places for his periods of reflection. For the true seeker, this is not escapism, but a direct, positive attempt to find out where he comes from by reflecting upon what is closest to him, that is, his own self. Finally, he may reach a point of neutrality in which hardly any more of that self is left and it has been recognized in all its aspects by the seeker. He will have seen every angle of the so-called personality. The Black Stone of the Ka\u2018bah When this has been seen, the seeker moves on single-pointedly to blacking out, symbolized by the Black Stone of the Ka\u2018bah. It's important to understand this symbol more deeply. We live in duality, and we seek to neutralize, but how do we neutralize? We neutralize our nafs by remaining silent , genuinely and positively. In that silence we have direct knowledge of the meaning of the Black Stone which is set into the corner of the Ka\u2018bah in Mecca. Few Muslims know the meaning of the Black Stone, even though they perform the rite of circling it and kissing it during the \u1e24ajj (pilgrimage) every year. Black contains all the colors \u2014 it symbolizes death, from which comes life. Life cannot be understood unless one is willing to die. Thus the Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , moves toward a state of no attributes, reaching, as the Sufis say, close to the suns of essence, moving away from the stars of attributes. First, he quietens his actions. Next, he moves into a subtler realm of attributes, and from there he crosses the boundary of essence. From that point on, one is traversing another realm. This process is not directly discernable or describable; another set of rules begins to apply. It is a no-man\u2019s land where no one can help anybody else, except by discussing its outer boundaries. It is an experiential state that everyone interprets differently. It is like an event which causes a great shock and which everybody tries to describe in a different language. It is a taste, a higher taste; it is a great opening. It is the explosive germination of the heart. Die Before You Die This opening is, of course, devastating as we see from what happened to Sayyidna Musa, \u2018alayhi-s-sal\u0101m . It is a shattering experience; it is not simply another experience of life, but rather of another realm. We can only go so far in understanding knowledge and information regarding our realm of consciousness which is in fact an aspect of a higher consciousness. It is like the story of a person who lives under water. He has a good consciousness of what is under water and he understands what goes on there. He may also have had quite a lot of glimpses of what is above water. But it is a different experience to actually be above water. No matter how much he may be prepared for it, it still is a shock, and when this occurred to the Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , he was in such a state of shock that some people even said he had gone mad. As a method for dealing with the views of others, the Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , often emphasized the importance of remembrance of death and being prepared for it at all times. \u2018Die before you die\u2019 is a frequently quoted tradition. The general meaning of the teaching is to be ready to leave this world in submission to the will of the generous and just God with ease and peace of mind. This state is attained by having the least amount of attachments to, and love of, worldly belongings and relationships. A deeper meaning is to let the lower consciousness die (\u2018lower life\u2019 is often quoted in the Qur\u2019an) and to live for and by the higher (\u2018other\u2019, \u2018later\u2019 or \u2018lasting\u2019 life), which relates to God consciousness. These teachings and Qur\u2019anic verses become transformative when one reflects and meditates upon the purpose and meaning of life and the human freedom and responsibility. Islam is the path of grooming the lower self and purifying the heart and unifying the self and soul. This spiritual evolvement will lift the individual consciousness out of the ever-changing worldly uncertainties to the domain of insights and inner delights. Whatever we love in this world we shall lose, except the sacred soul which lives on. When we remember that the end may come at any minute and we remember that we are suspended in air (one word related to nafs is nafas , meaning breath), we become more human. The Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , said, \u201cPeople are asleep, and when they die they wake up.\u201d True seekers want to die while being awake \u2014 they want to enter a state of total silence. All the practices of the men of Allah from time immemorial lead man, the seeker, to inner death while still alive. If, while we are conscious, aware, and scintillating with life, we can enter a state of self-abandonment, then we will understand what inner death is.

What is relevant to us today about Sufism is that it has maintained a clear thread and line of direct transmission of wisdom back to original Islam. The key to Sufism is that of inner awakening, freedom and joy through recognition of outer restriction by choice and discrimination. \u2026 The reason that the majority of current studies on Sufism are of little use in a practical sense is because of the nature of inner awakening itself, which is the core of Sufism. Writing books about inner awakening is only really possible if one has experienced it, just as understanding of such books is only really possible if one genuinely desires, or has already attained, such awakening. The Sufi is the locus of connecting the outer, physical reality with a timeless, spaceless dimension which is experienced within the self. The Sufi lives like the tip of the iceberg which is apparent in the seen world, while experiencing aspects of the hidden and veiled world which is the foundation of what is visible, and which forms the rest of its reality. He does his best to understand the causal, physical outer life while awakening to an immense inner Reality, which encompasses both the known and the unknown worlds, the unitive Reality of the seen and the unseen, of time and space and non-time-space. It is for this reason that the inner life of the Sufi has no bounds, and yet he acknowledges and accepts the outer bounds with courtesy towards nature and the natural creation. The Sufi is totally content with the immeasurable bliss within. Yet he struggles outwardly towards a better quality of life on earth and does his best without being overly concerned about the ultimate results. Outer struggle and work are necessary companions to inner purification and contentment. Genuine Sufis are essentially similar wherever they come from, in that they share an inner light and awakening, and an outer courtesy and service to humanity. Apparent differences between Sufis tend to relate to matters concerning spiritual practices or pointers for the purification of hearts. The sweet fruit of Sufism is the same. It is only the trees which may look different and which may flower in different seasons. In this work, we have tried to show that those who claim that it is possible to have Sufism without Islam are only looking at one side of the story. Inner purity is generally attainable, but without its being contained outwardly, it will not result in any real flourishing of a spiritual culture or an enlightened environment. Inner light and joy may be sufficient for an individual living in a cave, but once we start interacting with others, we need to know where and what the bounds are for that social interaction to be able to take place, and this is where we find that the laws of Islam are necessary and inseparable from Sufism. Emptying Out, Sweetening, Purifying The first step for a seeker to take is to witness, pure and simple. It is to be watchful, to be aware, to allow that which is higher in you to enable you to witness what goes on within you. In the state of watchfulness, at the beginning, there is usually a storm of thoughts. With guidance and perseverance, these bubbles of thoughts surface and vanish. This is the stage of emptying out. It is the cleaning of the mind-processor so that no psychological or emotional memories remain to contaminate the mind-computer. Then begins the process of sweetening. In order to achieve the ability to connect with the inner central core of one\u2019s self at any time and in any place, one needs to be sweetened. It is a process of displacement. It is like a bucket of muddy water which becomes purified by placing it under a running tap of sweet, clean water, until all the mud in the water has been displaced and the water in the bucket purified. The speed at which the tap flows depends on the size and capacity of the bucket. This is where a teacher is required for help. If the seeker is ready, the teacher simply pushes him into the ocean of awakening, which is what happened with Shaykh Abu\u2019l Hasan ash-Shadhili. When he reached his teacher, after having already mastered all the outer knowledges of Islam, he was simply asked to renew his ritual purification through washing. His spiritual master, Shaykh Abd as-Salam ibn Mashish, told him to descend the mountain and renew his ritual purification through washing and then to return, When Shaykh ash-Shadhili returned, it only took one look from his spiritual master for him to understand the meaning of all that had gone on before and after and the purpose of the meeting between the two of them. The seeker recognized the teacher and the teacher recognized the seeker instantaneously. However, there are those seekers who need continuous sweetening, encouragement and guidance before inward purification can occur. So sweetening is a process which is followed by purification. In actual life these three processes \u2013 emptying out, sweetening and purification \u2013 are carried out and take place simultaneously. They are three dimensions of the same process as they reinforce each other, leading toward the desired end result. They all go hand in hand. Surrendering Attachment Nothing is wrong with the world. There is nothing wrong with the creation. Everything is in a perfect form in its perfect place at the perfect time. It is my attitude towards it which causes me pain. The postman arrives and there is a letter for me informing me that a house in the countryside, which I love, has burned down and the roof has caved in. Those wonderful antique paintings are completely ruined. I am ruined! The Sufi says: \"You have to surrender. There is nothing wrong with the house provided that when it collapses, you do not collapse with it. It is the surrendering of the ownership/attachment aspect of it. The fact is, you can only carry out an activity efficiently if you are not attached to it. You can only run a business efficiently if you are not attached to it.\" The seeds of all emotional attributes are in us inwardly, otherwise we could not comprehend them when we see them outwardly. The seed of fear is in us, thus we all know what fear is. We all understand what pain is. We all understand what anger is. We understand all these things because we are all from the same source. We are all creatures of God, we have come from God and to God we return. We have all been created in the same manner with the same consciousness. We are all sons and daughters of Adam. And, therefore, from that point of view, \u2018I\u2019 the individual, the microcosm, reflect and contain the characteristics of the macrocosm. This is my little world and that is the entire world. But in my little world are to be found the miniatures of the outside world, and, therefore, the secrets of the outside world. We say we are looking for self-fulfilment. So there is nothing other than your own self-fulfilment. And that can only come when your mind is quiet. Conclusion The relevance of Sufism today is greater than it has been in any other age, for nowadays we can cross cultural and political boundaries much more easily, because of ease of access through communications, travel and closeness of the world. The message of Sufism is more urgent now, especially due to the fact that the world is increasingly becoming bound by materialism and consumerism. The awakening to the inner life of man is a necessary condition of his fulfillment as a human being. It comes as the pinnacle of his struggle with the elements and the fulfillment of his basic needs. Once our outer needs are met, then the inner must also be fulfilled. The two are so interlinked that those who are awakened to both the outer and inner realities see them as inseparable and continuous in the one creational, unific truth. The heart of an awakened being reflects the entire universe and such a being is described by the Sufi master, Ibn Arabi, in these words: My heart has become capable of every form: It is a pasture for gazelles, And a monastery for Christian monks, And a temple for idols, And the pilgrim\u2019s Ka\u2019bah, And the tablets of the Torah, And the Book of the Qur\u2018an. I follow the religion of Love: Whatever way Love\u2019s camel takes, That is my religion and my faith.","title":"Sufism and the Sufi"},{"location":"articles/sufism-sufi/#sufism-and-the-sufi","text":"By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, from the book \"Elements of Sufism\" .

It is like a bucket of muddy water which becomes purified by placing it under a running tap of sweet, clean water, until all the mud in the water has been displaced and the water in the bucket purified. The speed at which the tap flows depends on the size and capacity of the bucket. This is where a teacher is required for help. If the seeker is ready, the teacher simply pushes him into the ocean of awakening, which is what happened with Shaykh Abu\u2019l Hasan ash-Shadhili. When he reached his teacher, after having already mastered all the outer knowledges of Islam, he was simply asked to renew his ritual purification through washing. His spiritual master, Shaykh Abd as-Salam ibn Mashish, told him to descend the mountain and renew his ritual purification through washing and then to return, When Shaykh ash-Shadhili returned, it only took one look from his spiritual master for him to understand the meaning of all that had gone on before and after and the purpose of the meeting between the two of them. The seeker recognized the teacher and the teacher recognized the seeker instantaneously. However, there are those seekers who need continuous sweetening, encouragement and guidance before inward purification can occur. So sweetening is a process which is followed by purification. In actual life these three processes \u2013 emptying out, sweetening and purification \u2013 are carried out and take place simultaneously. They are three dimensions of the same process as they reinforce each other, leading toward the desired end result. They all go hand in hand.","title":"Emptying Out, Sweetening, Purifying"},{"location":"articles/sufism-sufi/#surrendering-attachment","text":"Nothing is wrong with the world. There is nothing wrong with the creation. Everything is in a perfect form in its perfect place at the perfect time. It is my attitude towards it which causes me pain. The postman arrives and there is a letter for me informing me that a house in the countryside, which I love, has burned down and the roof has caved in. Those wonderful antique paintings are completely ruined. I am ruined! The Sufi says: \"You have to surrender. There is nothing wrong with the house provided that when it collapses, you do not collapse with it. It is the surrendering of the ownership/attachment aspect of it. The fact is, you can only carry out an activity efficiently if you are not attached to it. You can only run a business efficiently if you are not attached to it.\" The seeds of all emotional attributes are in us inwardly, otherwise we could not comprehend them when we see them outwardly. The seed of fear is in us, thus we all know what fear is. We all understand what pain is. We all understand what anger is. We understand all these things because we are all from the same source. We are all creatures of God, we have come from God and to God we return. We have all been created in the same manner with the same consciousness. We are all sons and daughters of Adam. And, therefore, from that point of view, \u2018I\u2019 the individual, the microcosm, reflect and contain the characteristics of the macrocosm. This is my little world and that is the entire world. But in my little world are to be found the miniatures of the outside world, and, therefore, the secrets of the outside world. We say we are looking for self-fulfilment. So there is nothing other than your own self-fulfilment. And that can only come when your mind is quiet.","title":"Surrendering Attachment"},{"location":"articles/sufism-sufi/#conclusion","text":"The relevance of Sufism today is greater than it has been in any other age, for nowadays we can cross cultural and political boundaries much more easily, because of ease of access through communications, travel and closeness of the world. The message of Sufism is more urgent now, especially due to the fact that the world is increasingly becoming bound by materialism and consumerism. The awakening to the inner life of man is a necessary condition of his fulfillment as a human being. It comes as the pinnacle of his struggle with the elements and the fulfillment of his basic needs. Once our outer needs are met, then the inner must also be fulfilled. The two are so interlinked that those who are awakened to both the outer and inner realities see them as inseparable and continuous in the one creational, unific truth. The heart of an awakened being reflects the entire universe and such a being is described by the Sufi master, Ibn Arabi, in these words: My heart has become capable of every form: It is a pasture for gazelles, And a monastery for Christian monks, And a temple for idols, And the pilgrim\u2019s Ka\u2019bah, And the tablets of the Torah, And the Book of the Qur\u2018an.

The clear discipline and teachings of the great Sufi masters, such as Ibn \u2018Ata\u2019 Allah al- Iskandari, Abdullah Ansari, Ibn al-\u2018Arabi and Mulla Sadra, can help any serious spiritual seeker. Original Islam can now be practiced and lived by most people without fear of retribution from unjust and rigid authorities, who impose uniformity of thought in their fear of losing control over people\u2019s minds and hearts. The rise of social networking and the internet has made access to this rich heritage easy, though one has to sift through the sites judiciously for authentic and transformative teachings. During the past few decades research projects on the lives and teachings of numerous Sufi Shaykhs and spiritual masters have become popular. These studies have come out of European or American universities with a few from the east. Metaphysical poetry and spiritual songs have also been rediscovered and made public by literary and spiritually-oriented individuals and organizations. It is not an accident that Rumi has for many years been so frequently quoted and read in the West and is one of the best-selling poets in the States, probably in large part due to the interpretive translations of Coleman Barks and others. These are all signs that our scientific and material development is reaching a point that needs the revitalization of the heart and awakening to the inner light of the soul. Normal human consciousness is beginning to be regarded as one of many strands of accessible consciousness, starting from the local and conditioned state to full and boundless light of the cosmic consciousness \u2013 Allah. The golden thread amongst all of these works is the constant reference to an Essence or Reality that transcends all that is discerned by human senses and the mind. The idea of God being the preserve of a specific religion or people is being superseded by the durable idea of universal Oneness or supreme consciousness. Muslims, especially the Sufis, have constantly referred to the return to the truth that there is only one unique Essence (Allah, God) in creation and that everything else is simply an overflow of grace and manifestation of that primal light. Whatever there is in existence has a trace of its origin in it. Whatever is born will also die. This encourages the mind to reflect on what is eternally present and constant whilst also experiencing change and the dualities in creation. Whenever I asked an enlightened teacher what my duties in life ought to be, I received the same answer: as long as your focus is upon reducing your personal concern or \u2018separate identity\u2019, you are on the right track of liberating yourself from your \u2018lower\u2019 self. The Prophet Musa was ordered to take off his sandals (symbolizing protection and separation) before the Burning Bush. When personal identity or the illusion of independence is lost to a higher consciousness, then every moment and every place is sacred. For those, who have the will and interest to transcend the limitations of body and mind, the opportunities exist today, as they have always done. Sacredness is what holds the universe and consciousness of life. Humans are driven to realize the highest level of consciousness. Sufism is a natural human expression of the quest for knowledge of what connects and unifies the universe in all its diversity; the links of the seen and the unseen \u2013 the thread of Truth. Understanding Unity (Tawhid) Allah says: \"You are certainly on a clear path, a straight and direct way\" Qur'an, 36:04 The \u2018straight path\u2019 ( al-sirat al-mustaqim ) is the shortest distance between two points, between subject and object, between man and Allah. That is why it is direct, for it stretches from man to what he is always seeking, which is the All-Encompassing Reality. The understanding of unity (tawhid) is the straight path (al-sirat al-mustaqim), but it cannot be the subject of mere intellectual study. One must move along the path of submission (islam), through belief (iman) to sublime excellence (ihsan), until one begins to have glimpses of unity, through which one can then dive into the world of meaning. If the goal of unity ( tawhid ) is not constantly present in the minds of the Muslims, their Islam becomes diluted and falls by the wayside. Mosques become either totally empty or only superficially full, because most of the people there are attending only as a matter of form. In many parts of the Muslim world this is what one finds, because the path is no longer about remembrance of Allah ( dhikru\u2019llah ), nor about wanting knowledge of Allah. In many places Islam itself has been put on a pedestal and is being worshipped instead of Allah. Islam, however, is a means to the knowledge of Allah, not the object itself. We all love what is timeless. We all love what is absolute. Does anyone not want to live forever, past this life and on into the next? This means that we all love the One Who is forever living. The love of Allah, therefore, is already in our hearts, but we become diverted, we rationalize: \u2018Not now, tomorrow or next year, when I finish with this or that business.\u2019 We blame other people for our lack of time and all our other problems as well.

In a similar way, there are two versions of being alive. Conditioned Consciousness The first version is the simple awareness of being a living, breathing human being; this is sentiency. We say, \u201cI am alive because I am conscious and through that consciousness I can manipulate my hand or my movement\u201d. This is the definition and experience of conditioned consciousness. It is the idea of having your own life and asking, \u201cWhat are you doing with your life?\u201d It\u2019s the idea that \u201clife is precious\u201d \u201ctime is precious\u201d \u201ceverything will pass\u201d \u201cyou only have one life to live\u201d. This places us in a box where we remain anchored to our perception of what \u201cour life\u201d is. It is this box that causes the fear, anxiety and concern when reflecting on the inevitable cycle of birth and death. Combined Consciousness The second version of being alive is when limited, conditioned life, is combined with Life itself. This is truly being alive. To understand this better we first need to again consider the experience of limited consciousness and limited life. Rabbit consciousness, chimpanzee consciousness and intelligent philosopher consciousness are all limited, conditioned \u2018consciousness\u2019s\u2019. Each is different in its own way, and each is constantly changing through every moment. In the same way, each person experiences their own life and consciousness as constantly changing. Within this field of constant change we also experience everything as good or bad. Yet, we may have fooled ourselves into thinking that anything can really ever be good or bad. Lets take bright light as an example. Bright light may be too hot and too bright and therefore be judged, in a particular moment, as bad. But it is not the light that is bad; it is the perception of the light that is bad. The light itself is beyond judgements of good or bad, it is simply light. If the perception of light does not lead to the discovery of infinite light then I am not alive. And if I am not alive, then all the moments where I had joy are inconsequential because they have not lead me to the ultimate mine of joys that I can plug into. Only experience of the infinite light, beyond individual perception and judgement, will ever be good enough. In perceiving light, I have been given a small jewel that was brought from the mine of infinite light, and if I have no access to the mine, it is not good enough. What we all really seek is that which is permanently continuous and permanently connected. We do not want anything that may abruptly end. With any apparent disconnection, with any break from the infinite light we feel sad, we feel depressed. So human purpose, above the purpose of daily tasks and ambitions, is only to connect your life with Life itself. Connect your life with the Life from which your life is drawing its energy. If that is done, all is done. If that is not done, nothing is ever enough. Otherness and Oneness From mysterious Oneness, a plethora of every type of energy, matter and other realities emerged as every imaginable energy, material form, cycles or patterns in dualities, that balance each other. Pluralities emanate from the One and return to the One. Dualities appear as opposites or complimentary. They are twins. The two quarreling traders appear opposite to each other. Whereas in fact they are competing for what seems to them of limited availability. Dualities confirm unity. Disagreements and differences are due to perceiving otherness. He is not one of us; not the same religion, not the same nation. Even when obsessed by the desire to perceive through Oneness. Eyesight, memory and habit mask this Truth. The genesis of the veil of otherness is conditioned consciousness of human beings for survival. You notice mostly that which is different and ignore the familiar. The herder noticed somebody else with his goats and felt threatened. Animal survival needs. Otherness enforces the animal self for survival, protection and earthly ongoingness. Once you have actually experienced forever-ness of your own Soul then there would be a considerable erosion of the feeling of otherness. The awakened person sees sameness of essence and outer differences. The enlightened person only sees through the lens of Oneness. Reflective people become more aware of the light of the Soul. Life is work in progress. Otherness is a reminder of Oneness. Otherness is an outer encrustation or shell that has within it, the light of Oneness. The root of everything is Oneness. The present moment is only there because of Perpetual Oneness. Now slides through newness creating in its wake the experience of moving time. Now tomorrow is another time but yet is the same now. An illusion within space and time that seems to have changed. It has changed within the box of conditioned consciousness. But consciousness itself never changes. Truth is ever constant, only shadows emanating from it appear to change. Every entity indicates its sacred origin, often in subtle or veiled ways! Summing Up (to One) The formula for this process of accessing the infinite light is to do only with limited consciousness. It is the removal of all obstacles, and thereafter, higher consciousness remains. It is the process of saying \u201cno, no, no\u201d to everything else, but the infinite light. Then there is connection and continuity in perpetuity, outside of the limited box of personal consciousness. My personal cycle of birth and death is the magical connector between the infinite and finite, between metaphysics and physics. We are \u2018middle people\u2019, caught in the middle. Experientially, through head and heart, I need to experience being in the middle and being the connector between the infinite and the finite.

In terms of consciousness - and not just human consciousness, but all consciousness - we are now at a stage in our evolution where we can truly address the Ultimate, we can truly talk about the Absolute, we can talk about Godhead, and we can talk about the cosmic light that is not subject to space and time. It is for this reason that I am not an advocator of a specific path. They\u2019ve all served their purposes. They\u2019ve all been very useful. Each one is like a river which has emanated from higher up and flowed down to serve orchards, communities, and civilizations. We are all beneficiaries of these streams. Yet I am not advocating that we spurn tradition. The appeal of the past remains because it has a touch of timelessness. That\u2019s why we sanctify our particular path by ascribing ancientness to it. We love that which is old, because it touches the beginning of time; and we also love that which is new, because it\u2019s just been born out of what is beyond space and time. All I am saying is that we are at an age where we want what is truly durable, beyond the limitations of culture, civilization, religion or language. This edge is the Absolute Truth, which is the source and cause of life for every living creature. The life in me is a mysterious reality which, if I truly refer to it, enables me to touch the infinite\u2013that which is boundless and unseen. Then the moment becomes sanctified, it becomes graced. If I am touching the timeless in me, then it\u2019s difficult for me to lie, to camouflage, to be a hypocrite, to say things which are not true. If I constantly remember the Absolute by giving up everything else and being only at that Light of lights, then I am alive. This is what is needed. Because it is not happening enough in our time, we suffer from the most dreadful leadership at every level in our lives. Every leader has their own particular agenda and is bent on enriching themselves. If their agenda were to enable anyone who is meek, weak and low to evolve to the highest in their own heart then it would be good. If not, it is another form of slavery and I cannot subscribe to it. I am not here to wage war against it: it will vanish by itself. I know - it\u2019s not that I believe - that in the very instant of the so-called Big Bang, there was a flash of awareness of awareness of awareness that continued and, after billions of years, it has reached a stage in human beings where many of us are now able to question any aspect of cause and effect and reach a point in intelligence where there is no more duality. The One prevails. If you calibrate with the One, then you can deal with the twos. Yes, of course, you are two! One moment you are asleep, which is not the same as when you are awake. But they are facets of One, and you are one. You contain within you the secrets and the magic and the miracle of the One. God in you. That is why we have carried this brilliant teaching from early on in history: \u201cIf you kill one person, it is as though you have killed the whole of creation. And if you bring one person to full awareness and life, you have brought to life all of creation.\u201d This is the truth. It is not local to any religion. This is it. If you do that, then the rest doesn\u2019t matter so much. Whatever occupation you have is fine. None of it has a sting in it any longer, and you won\u2019t subscribe to gangsterism, to which so many succumb. So many businesses are run in fact by gangsters. The mafia are probably the most honourable ones. The rest are corporate gangsters seeking the power of monopoly. Why? Because you want to rule, because you want to be God. Why? Because God\u2019s light is in you. So you want to become God, but this can never be: it is madness. That is the message.","title":"Universality, Locality & The Human"},{"location":"articles/who-are-you-where-are-you/","text":"When the nature of the soul is realized, then the ideas of freedom or choice disappear and what remains is blissful peace. We start life being puzzled by movements, shapes, colours and touches. One of the first things a baby is curious about is taste - they put things in their mouths. Then comes tactile connectedness: feeling shapes, moving yourself, navigating darkness and light. We begin life with a constant drive to understand and explore. We want to understand the meaning of what is around us. The underlying, primal factor is safety and survival. We are driven by that inner notion which says, \u201cDon\u2019t die! Survive, cope, relate, be flexible - for however long flexibility lasts.\u201d That which is too rigid breaks, which is to say that entropy claims it more suddenly. To keep on living is an innate drive in anything that is alive. It has a touch of life and does not want to lose it. The question, \u201cWho am I?\u201d arises due to that touch, because I want to cope, connect and continue. Otherwise, the self is of no interest. You are given a name and a description, but so what? You might as well be a mosquito. Tell me how is this mosquito - or any living entity - able to flow with the flow so that it honours its origin, which is a touch of eternal Light? Life is eternal, so honouring that is the same as wanting to be here forever. Anything that experiences life is actually honouring that sacred stamp. Bounded Eternity Peace is at the edge of space and time. It is still, stable, and constant. Life is eternal and boundless. I am alive by its courtesy, so I want the same. Otherwise, who am I? It changes every two minutes! I am silent, I am the speaker, I am awake, I am asleep, I am this, I am that. It\u2019s endless! The different facets of \u201cwho am I?\u201d are endless: I am a friend, I am a foe, I am a predator, I am prey. The reason I want to know who I am is so that I can excel in the practice of the flow. Of continuity. Of foreverness. Of the boundless and eternal. That\u2019s it. The purpose of this enquiry is that. Not to reach any conclusion that is fixed as a monument. You are not a monument that will be put up somewhere as the founder of some thing or another. It\u2019s about my essential, constant, innate drive for eternity, for perpetuity. That\u2019s why I want to know who I am. The answer is that you are a mysterious energy package - which we call life, or soul, or spirit, or any name you like to give it - whose nature is not in space and time. It\u2019s as though it has emerged from a quantum field that is beyond. However, it is now manifesting within the limitations of time and space, expressed fully and firmly by the limitations of your body. Slightly less obvious is the limitation of your mind, imagination and creativity. The puzzle is the confinement of that which is boundless. That is really all that it is. Accept that this is the truth, that it is not subject to any movement in space or time, and yet it is caught within these dimensions. It is heavenly energies or light caught in a loop of birth and death - or beginning and end - on earth. It is a celestial Reality beyond the mind in the limited realm of terrestrial movement, space and time. That is the story. Realise that there is an aspect in you that is boundless, limitless, timeless, non-discernible and therefore beyond your mind, while also accepting that the only way you can deal with anything - unless you a certified lunatic or completely mad - is to exist within the boundaries of space and time. Space is like the frame of a picture and time is whatever is inside it, and is changing all the time. The Spectrum We experience change and movement due to the stable nature of our soul. I, as a human being within humanity, am subject to these limitations, though I am energised by the limitless. The smallest thing may suffice my needs but, in truth, nothing is ever really enough, because Truth is the celestial light in me. As a human, I have to learn how to be content, because I am bound by limitation. However, the human is only there because of the divine light in it! Each one of us straddles these extremes: at one end it\u2019s boundless, spaceless, timeless - it\u2019s God. But we can\u2019t talk about God. We can only talk about attributes of existence, realities, creations; right down to the cosmos, galaxies, Big Bang, Big Collapse and so on. We are celestial energies journeying in a terrestrial realm where there are zillions of differentiable entities. Size, shape, colour, smell, taste and all the experiences within our five senses, which are like our tentacles that we use to try and make sense of more and more of the spectrum. If you ignore humanity, you cannot talk about spirituality - there is no way! If you only dwell upon that, then you cannot appear as a human. Disappear into that realm and don\u2019t bother us. However, if you say, \u201cNo! I am primarily a human being, and everybody else has the same potential,\u201d then there is justice. Without accepting that all other human beings have the same potential, then you start on a trajectory that will cause nothing other than suffering. Humanity has not yet reconciled that - no matter what colour, size, shape, education and so on we each have - essentially, we are the same. Once you accept that, then all of these issues - whether it is race, colour, economic advantage etc. - become secondary. If you have been given all the training, you can play all the tricks and make money this way or that, which is fine. It has some reality, but the Real is that light within the heart of everyone. So, \u201cWho am I?\u201d is \u201cWho are we?\u201d and it is that amazing challenge which can only be lived, not discussed too much. You are a heavenly light, but don\u2019t start playing God. You have a godly touch, though you are infatuated with the \u201cgoldly\u201d chase or desire, because you are on earth so you cannot escape the natural drive to excel. We all want to be Number One. But you are already Number One! You are one out of billions of other Number Ones. Everybody is a Number One! That\u2019s it. Accept that you are special, special, special beyond description, and so is everyone else. So is everything else. So is every atom! Then you are balanced, in the sense that you know you are hanging on the dualities of this earth, but energised by Unity that is beyond space and time and any limitation.","title":"Who Are You, Where Are You?"},{"location":"articles/who-are-you-where-are-you/#bounded-eternity","text":"Peace is at the edge of space and time.

Shaykh Fadhlallah provides a brushstroke overview of the major topics to be covered in an extended retreat in Britain. The talk begins by reflecting on several contemporary issues, such as the modern world; the economic system and its social reality; humans in the history of both the evolution of life on earth and the cosmos; and the nature of consciousness. Shaykh Fadhlalla then narrows in on several key issues. The first takes the form of some foundational questions: Who are we? What is sentiency? What is the human journey? What is the 'spectrum of consciousness\u2019? How can we understand decree and destiny? Shaykh then unpacks the Academy of Self Knowledge's basic presentation of human cosmology, titled \"Self \u2013 Soul\" and discusses the arrow of time and evolution of consciousness. From this, he moves into an examination of human heritage through cultures, history, religion and the underlying drive at the core of our experience and behaviour.

Human Consciousness Listen The Perpetual Now The present moment is the most potent and powerful link to the essence of time. A tree is a good metaphor for indicating the dynamic manifestation of Reality in every moment. From the 'Root of Oneness', creation occurs as dispersion. This occurs over time as well as in every moment. Ordinarily, we don't experience the amazing inseparability implicit in how Oneness becomes sunlight and water, and how these become the flower, and how the flower becomes beautiful fragrance. Yet, they are seamlessly connected. There are many different strands that we can follow to explain this Unitive Totality. The most universally understandable is through the description of the experience of Now. In this recording Shaykh Fadhlalla takes the listener on a journey through an enlightened experience of the Now. The Perpetual Now Listen Enlightenment It contains all, yet there is no thing in the present. It is in time, yet free of time. This is a more intimate recording made at the Enlightenext centre in London. Shaykh Fadhlallah presents a personal account of his experience and understanding of the Sufi Path, reflecting on several fundamental questions and paradoxes surrounding human life. He begins by examining whether there is an optimum way to live, using this question to present a map of creation which can be used to live a life of fulfilment, equanimity and ease. Shaykh connects the description and application of this map with the evolutionary process which any traveler must undergo. We all want to rise in consciousness and this presents various challenges in both the social and experiential dynamics of living the fullness of human reality. Shaykh Fadhlalla draws from the Abrahamic, Sufi, and Muhammadi traditions to present the various levels which the traveler might discover and arrive at in their navigation of the path. The emphasis is placed on the need for a lived experience of truth. Moreover, it is not only about walking along the road, but arriving at \u2018The City\u2019. This and several other key metaphors are used to portray the nature of the path and warn of the multitudes of pitfalls the seeker encounters. The nature of harmony and balance; the interplay between the relative and the absolute; the Sufi sketch of higher and lower self and the nature of the authentic self; all this and more is presented in this talk. \"We can sum up this issue of Oneness by repeating \u201cone, two; one, two; One!\u201d From the One comes the two, and two seek to reproduce one; and that one is looking for its origin in duality, only to realize that the entire thing emanated from \u2018The One\u2019.

Once you grasp that such a sacred reference point exists within you, then talk of a map is no longer necessary. In fact, the map is no longer necessary, because it becomes just another kind of false security. The key question remains, 'Are you in The City?' And then, 'Have you discovered that there is actually neither you nor City?' The entire Light, which is beyond both known and unknown, is in you already. That is truly awesome. That is why one has to move with good conduct, with authenticity and genuine honesty, according to who you are. Here is the basis of arrival.\" Further talks on this topic can be found in the complete series . Enlightenment Listen Inner Striving and Joy Are Inseparable Shaykh Fadhlalla begins by reflecting upon several of the major paradoxes and challenges facing human beings today. In a precise yet overarching manner, the challenges of modernity, history and the evolution of Islamic civilization in contrast to western society is considered. The wider elements of a materialistic world culture and the dominant social forces in the modern arena are contrasted with a framework for discerning and accessing the meanings of the current status quo on the variety of collective and individual issues facing human beings today. This framework is built around the application and relatability of essential Islam; the revealed and distilled knowledges regarding natural patterns and the cycles of life; the purpose of human life and the pathways and indications in moving along the intended arc of human evolvement. Some key paradoxes on the path of abandonment are relayed: reduction and expansion; trust and responsibility; generosity and confinement with reference to various Qur\u2019anic verse and prophetic teachings. The discourse elaborates upon the interplay of various forces in applying and relating knowledge appropriately so that we may witness and taste divine mercy in all circumstances, whilst persistently yearning and striving along the path of reality. Inner Striving and Joy Are Inseparable Listen Islam and Tawhid All life and awareness has emerged from One source which is the only perpetual reality. This talk reflects upon a core aspect of the Islamic unveilings and path. Shaykh Fadhlalla seeks to elaborate and emphasize a living experience of the varying dimensions and modes for the traveler on the path of Oneness. Tawhid is the unequivocal statement of the oneness of reality. Shaykh explores the Qur\u2019anic declaration of a total, single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible reality, entirely independent of creation, out of which complexity and multiplicity emanate and return. The Qur\u2019anic cosmology is introduced as a model of understanding the unitive nature of reality at its various levels, or the various levels of Tawhid . In this talk, Shaykh Fadhlallah examines each of these: Tawhid Af\u2019al - the unity of actions Tawhid al Sifat - the unity of attributes Tawhid ad Dhat - the unity of essence Shaykh Fadhlalla presents the appropriate way in which one should relate to and understand this model and, critically, how to integrate it into a living process. He continues with an elaboration on key elements around this integral work. He also discusses the necessity of various virtues: honesty; authenticity in reflection; the meaning of worship; the reality of salaat and the fulfillment of its inner dynamics; sincerity; and the practice of remembrance, or dhikr . The entire talk is well summarised by this key excerpt: \u201cYou can do it quietly, you don\u2019t have to tell people, you don\u2019t have to show off. Nothing changes! Be as you are. No need to change and say, \u2018I am now a different person!\u2019 You are not. You are the same idiot you have been all along, it\u2019s just that your channel to Allah is clearly open, and you recognize that higher Reality. Prostrate yourself and you will come to see that there is nowhere where Allah is not.\u201d Islam and Tawhid Listen Die Before You Die Once we have tasted timelessness we may come to realize the presence of eternity within our own heart: the perpetual moment. The title of this talk is a translation of a famous tradition from the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), relating to the process of inner death. Shaykh Fadhlalla elaborates on several of life\u2019s fundamental questions - who are we?, what is death?, and how should we relate to it? - as a prelude to delving into the spiritual dimensions of this famous axiom of the prophetic, original Islamic path. Shaykh reflects on some contemporary near death experiences as a window into a fundamental understanding of reality. As always, he contrasts the changing nature of limited transitory experience with the boundless, unseen, unknown. He then explores some key indications from amongst various Islamic and Sufi contributors, all of whom elaborate on the internal mechanisms and meanings of death as a key to awakening to truth. An understanding of the complementary nature of the forces of life and death is given, interspersed with reflections on Qur\u2019anic verses, terms, pointers and descriptions of the world, the next life, and the process of inner death as the purification of your heart's clutter. This decreases one's attachment to a transient life, allowing for amplified resonance with the soul within. Various allusions to the classical cosmology of the self are made, and death is modelled as the transcendence of limited consciousness into the zone of higher consciousness.

The wider elements of a materialistic world culture and the dominant social forces in the modern arena are contrasted with a framework for discerning and accessing the meanings of the current status quo on the variety of collective and individual issues facing human beings today. This framework is built around the application and relatability of essential Islam; the revealed and distilled knowledges regarding natural patterns and the cycles of life; the purpose of human life and the pathways and indications in moving along the intended arc of human evolvement. Some key paradoxes on the path of abandonment are relayed: reduction and expansion; trust and responsibility; generosity and confinement with reference to various Qur\u2019anic verse and prophetic teachings. The discourse elaborates upon the interplay of various forces in applying and relating knowledge appropriately so that we may witness and taste divine mercy in all circumstances, whilst persistently yearning and striving along the path of reality.

This talk reflects upon a core aspect of the Islamic unveilings and path. Shaykh Fadhlalla seeks to elaborate and emphasize a living experience of the varying dimensions and modes for the traveler on the path of Oneness. Tawhid is the unequivocal statement of the oneness of reality. Shaykh explores the Qur\u2019anic declaration of a total, single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible reality, entirely independent of creation, out of which complexity and multiplicity emanate and return. The Qur\u2019anic cosmology is introduced as a model of understanding the unitive nature of reality at its various levels, or the various levels of Tawhid . In this talk, Shaykh Fadhlallah examines each of these: Tawhid Af\u2019al - the unity of actions Tawhid al Sifat - the unity of attributes Tawhid ad Dhat - the unity of essence Shaykh Fadhlalla presents the appropriate way in which one should relate to and understand this model and, critically, how to integrate it into a living process. He continues with an elaboration on key elements around this integral work. He also discusses the necessity of various virtues: honesty; authenticity in reflection; the meaning of worship; the reality of salaat and the fulfillment of its inner dynamics; sincerity; and the practice of remembrance, or dhikr . The entire talk is well summarised by this key excerpt: \u201cYou can do it quietly, you don\u2019t have to tell people, you don\u2019t have to show off. Nothing changes! Be as you are. No need to change and say, \u2018I am now a different person!\u2019 You are not. You are the same idiot you have been all along, it\u2019s just that your channel to Allah is clearly open, and you recognize that higher Reality. Prostrate yourself and you will come to see that there is nowhere where Allah is not.\u201d Islam and Tawhid Listen","title":"Islam and Tawhid"},{"location":"audios/selected-talks/#die-before-you-die","text":"Once we have tasted timelessness we may come to realize the presence of eternity within our own heart: the perpetual moment. The title of this talk is a translation of a famous tradition from the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), relating to the process of inner death. Shaykh Fadhlalla elaborates on several of life\u2019s fundamental questions - who are we?, what is death?, and how should we relate to it? - as a prelude to delving into the spiritual dimensions of this famous axiom of the prophetic, original Islamic path. Shaykh reflects on some contemporary near death experiences as a window into a fundamental understanding of reality. As always, he contrasts the changing nature of limited transitory experience with the boundless, unseen, unknown. He then explores some key indications from amongst various Islamic and Sufi contributors, all of whom elaborate on the internal mechanisms and meanings of death as a key to awakening to truth. An understanding of the complementary nature of the forces of life and death is given, interspersed with reflections on Qur\u2019anic verses, terms, pointers and descriptions of the world, the next life, and the process of inner death as the purification of your heart's clutter. This decreases one's attachment to a transient life, allowing for amplified resonance with the soul within. Various allusions to the classical cosmology of the self are made, and death is modelled as the transcendence of limited consciousness into the zone of higher consciousness.

Die Before You Die This talk presents an exposition on death as a key issue in the conundrum of existence. The phenomena of birth and death are one of several key pairs in the map of existence. This talk reflects on what the appropriate response is to such conundrums. The enquiry revolves around three questions: who am I; who is God or the essence; and what is death? Shaykh Fadhlalla presents both the interrelation and particularity of these three issues, broadening the field of enquiry into the meaning of death. Various references are made to contemporary areas of interest such as Near Death Experiences and the multifaceted implications for human consciousness these exposures may engender.

This discussion is a detailed exposition of two of life\u2019s fundamental forces: fear and hope. These two forces are critical complementary dynamics that frame the basket of human life. Shaykh Fadhlalla presents human interaction and experience of fear as a pivotal force in the evolutionary drive within human consciousness and indicates the context in which ancient cultures framed their vision of the world by virtue of the lens of this phenomena, hence the cultural and linguistic dynamics of those peoples reflect this relation. This is contrasted to the model of life encountered by modern man in which hope and good expectation are the primary forces that filter perception. An understanding of the parallels of this evolutionary dimension is critical in approaching revealed knowledges and ancient tradition in the drive to appropriately connect with the timeless meaning beneath the relative filter of these emergences. This episode presents the existential sketch of the categories of fear before introducing the Qur\u2019anic model expounding upon the degrees of fear in relation to Higher consciousness.

A complex and detailed exposition on both issues is presented, via the references of the linguistic dynamics of various Qur\u2019anic terms, prophetic teachings and injunctions towards the true meaning of the good life by referring to the complementarity of these forces, reflecting upon the directives that are presented in referencing life\u2019s events within this intrinsic design.

Remembrance is a sign. Experiencing the light within is to be celebrated. These talks cover modern approaches for moving from information to transformation; broken down for ease of understanding into four gateways of enlightenment. Hij'ra The first of these doors is hij'ra : to cut off, cut back, or leave behind. This cutting or leaving occurs at numerous levels. It includes physically moving, but the inner meaning is to do with departing from the movements and activity of the mind. This means abandoning your general mental habits and thoughts and turning away from your personal tendencies and attachments. Hij'ra is, in fact, a perpetual process. Fears, habits, and attachment to situations always occur and remain whilst living in this world. The dynamics of hij'ra are further elaborated as an essential inner quality that appears as outward action. By selecting and discussing a few specific verses from the Qur\u2019an, Shaykh Fadhlalla describes an updated and user-friendly map for moving away from the lower self and recognizing the higher that is always-already there, within you. Select Qur\u2019anic beams are relayed in concordance with different aspects and subtleties of \u2018turning away\u2019. Ultimately, Allah or Supreme Consciousness is not subject to distance, or time. Inner stability is borne by the recognition of change and difference, from which we must make hij'ra , using a reference for our journey ever-present, constant, Oneness. Episode 1 \u2013 Hij\u2019ra Listen Niyyah The second in this series of talks begins with a short overview of the previous path gateway: hij'ra \u2013 departure, severance from that which is not conducive. There are many stages and degrees of departure and turning away along the arc of human evolvement. It is not sufficient just to depart from one's bad habits, wem must also act in this world and so arrive at the second gateway: right intention ( niyyah ) and good action. Like hij'ra , niyyah occurs at numerous different levels along the path of true transformation. The Prophetic profile is presented as the living model of complete harmony in intention, action and character - a living tablet of the revealed knowledges. The essential nature of intention is also explored, relevant to the interplay of opposites, and some of the subtle elements in the meeting of intention and action within the human being. All human beings end up in their ultimate destiny according to their niyyah . The importance of the essential virtues of honesty and sincerity that ally purified intention are discussed in various modes. Prophetic lore, Sufi traditions and Qur\u2019anic verses are also described so as to present the fine edges of total self-awareness and inner accountability in which these qualities serve as the keys to true abandonment and thus the birth of a steady state of wholesomeness and inner expansiveness. \u201cLet go, because you don\u2019t have it! Let go of what? Of life. Who gave you this life? Practice it now and you\u2019ll be amazed that you are the guest of the Creator. Why not now? Why not every day, every instant? Practice it.\u201d Episode 2 \u2013 Niyyah Listen Refinement The first two talks in this series cover the complementary opposites which serve as the foundation of creation and the dualities all human beings encounter in the journey of transformation. First is to avoid evil, that which retards development and enlightenment. We make hij'ra from that which is unacceptable. In doing so, one becomes conscious of niyyah , or \u2018intention\u2019, and can learn to use this such that action is constantly directed in the highest possible direction, at numerous different levels. Having departed from that which is not conducive and brought goodness and wholesomeness into awareness, the traveler arrives at a dangerous interspace which must be navigated with care. The third gateway to enlightenment is refinement of one\u2019s thoughts and actions; which operates in tandem with watchfulness and witnessing. Life is a process. All of life is a work in progress and there is no end to striving. The gateway of refinement requires attention, vigilance and diligence so that one becomes rooted in higher wisdom. There are numerous important references and subtle indications presented in this discourse via Qur\u2019anic verses and the prophetic teachings relevant to this stage of development: commitment, access to the zone of durable joy, constant watchfulness of the lower self, and an appreciation of the meaning of guidance are the essential themes. The necessity for constant accountability, right references and companionship is emphasized until it is discovered that guidance, authority, and light come from within the purified heart. \u201cAllah\u2019s guidance comes from Allah according to the purification of your heart. You have made your hijra. You are constantly accountable. You are performing the best you can. You are beginning to taste happiness and joy for itself and by itself, not as a passing pleasure. It is just here. This is not about a pleasing-but-passing state: it is about developing a permanent station, secured by truth and faith in what is.\u201d \u201cYou accept worldly challenges and deny nothing, but you are constantly referring them to the zone of Oneness, to the light in your heart. Here, human tragedies become comedies. You will not have higher humor until you refer it to the One. Then it is no longer success and failure, but perpetual victory by reference to the Ever-Victorious.\u201d Episode 3 \u2013 Refinement Listen Ihsan The final talk in the series presents the Gateway of ihsan - the station of contentment or excellence, otherwise known as makam al\u2019ihsan . The previous three talks emphasized the modes and means of completing humanity, or how to perfect the science of acceptance and willful surrender: being completely in Islam . This process evolves into the refinement of awareness, perception and watchfulness, perfecting Iman : faith and trust in the totality and the Unicity of reality. It culminates in Ihsan : the threshold of being. The key themes explored in this talk are the nature of selfless service and its parameters; perfected resonance with truth; the meaning of refined watchfulness; and total instantaneous accountability. Arriving at this gate means you have done all that you can, and continue to strive to your utmost. The dawning of self-knowledge - the station of ma\u2019arifa - is also discussed, leading into a brief presentation on the levels of unity and the dynamics of living in full consciousness, coupled with living awareness. In this state, one witnesses the perfection of truth encompassing and within all states and experiences. Various Qur\u2019anic verses reflecting different aspects of the states and stages surrounding this station are discussed as the motive force required to reach this gate. The meaning of the completed person and some of the key driving forces of human life are discussed through the vista and lens of excellence, with reference to the Prophetic profile. Shaykh Fadhlalla shares several fundamental keys to constancy, unfolding awareness and resonance with Essence, coupled with the appropriate general indications, warnings and guides. \u201cTo go into the ultimate mi\u2019raj , flying beyond limits, you have to put your face into dust, and die. Look at the miracle of Creation! Everywhere you turn, there is the Face of Allah. What do you see that is not perfect? As The Prophet (pbuh) said, \u201cWhen you can see your affliction as a gift, you are entering into the boundlessness of ihsan .\u201d Episode 4 \u2013 Ihsan Listen When you discover the bliss that emanates from your own soul, you are awakening to the Divine promise.","title":"Gateways"},{"location":"audios/series/gateways-to-enlightenment/#gateways-to-enlightenment","text":"The road sign to a city is not the city.

This series addresses questions such as: Who am I? What is consciousness? How do I find Spiritual meaning in everyday experiences of the material world, even tragedies? What about fate and intention? It goes into detail on the dynamics of self and soul, discussing how we experience light by its shadow and other seeming paradoxes. Shaykh Fadhlalla then moves on to discuss the heart and how it can be tarnished, the concepts of personality, birth, death, fear, mirrors and the role of leadership. The series concludes by asking why we don't intuitively and instinctively seek the higher, why the path to so-called \"enlightenment\" is often presented as something mysterious or mystical, and with an offering of some practical advice for those actively seeking enlightenment.

You are a composite of body, mind, intellect and light - what we call soul or spirit - which activates all the layers of consciousness you experience. If you can keep these all in balance and focus your attention on the meanings behind physical forms, you may come to realise that you are not just the mind or intellect. In truth, you are a boundless light and it is your soul that gives sentience and energy to all the different facets of your experience.

Episode 1 Listen Transcript 2 - Light and Shadows This talk approaches the topic of genuine self-knowledge through the metaphor of light and shadow. Through a series of questions about what drives us, what distracts us, and the apparent schizophrenia of our existence as worldly beings capable of knowing and embodying divine attributes, Shaykh Fadhlalla explores how we can use a clear and precise awareness of the shadowy sides of our lower self as the impetus required to turn towards the ever-present, perfect Light which gives life to all being. Once you know fully your limitations, it becomes possible to just accept them. Then you will be accepted by the limitless which is already in you. Episode 2 Listen Transcript 3 - The Soul After exploring how this world manifests as opposites through the metaphor of light and shadows, this talk moves into a discussion of the soul, guidance, leadership and how we can live with reference to the zone of constancy, reliability, stability and trustworthiness within. Shaykh Fadhlalla speaks about this \u201ctuning\u201d and resonance at many levels - personal responsibility, collective mirroring and social culture - all of which can help us make ever more constant reference to the One Absolute Good which is contained within, and reflected by, our soul. Episode 3 Listen Transcript 4 - The Map Having understood that you are the meeting point of light and shadow, and that this point can be understood and contained via constant reference to the soul within your heart, you now have to navigate along the map of existence, firmly between and capable of applying the prophetic template to every instant of life. Shaykh Fadhlalla discusses what it means to move along this map, what the highway codes are, and how this applies to religion, dogma, spirituality and the traps of spiritual materialism, ending with a discussion about Sufism and trust. Episode 4 Listen Transcript 5 - Conducting the Ultimate Quest Know your essential makeup; navigate between light and shadow with constant reference to the soul in your heart; accept the map of existence with its various road signs; and now perfect your conduct through constant awareness of death. If you are not ready to leave this world, then you are not qualified to take it, because it will take you. The two go together. If you are ready to abandon it, then you have access to the abundance of it. Turn away from that which is not; that which has always been is. Your job and duty is to accept limitations and the short duration of this life with humility and, if you can do so and use it as a platform to view what is shedding light upon this life, then you have access - inadvertently - to the limitless. You become godly ; you do not become God with the implied spiritual pomposity. You become simply, consciously illumined. You were already illumined before without knowing it. Now you know it, _and _you know its shadow. You live by the two, through the courtesy of One.

This series addresses questions such as: Who am I? What is consciousness? How do I find Spiritual meaning in everyday experiences of the material world, even tragedies? What about fate and intention? It goes into detail on the dynamics of self and soul, discussing how we experience light by its shadow and other seeming paradoxes. Shaykh Fadhlalla then moves on to discuss the heart and how it can be tarnished, the concepts of personality, birth, death, fear, mirrors and the role of leadership. The series concludes by asking why we don't intuitively and instinctively seek the higher, why the path to so-called \"enlightenment\" is often presented as something mysterious or mystical, and with an offering of some practical advice for those actively seeking enlightenment.

Why do things exist? Why do I exist? Why do things happen to me? This is particularly true of suffering, which encourages a deeper search for meaning. This series examines all aspects of the self, and getting in touch with the higher in ourselves.\u201d What am I? Essentially, you are what you make yourself. You are a product of your mind. You are a product of your past. You are a product of your aspirations and desires. You are a mixture of the lower and the higher self. You are a complete composite of body, mind, intellect and light; which we call soul or spirit, that activates all the layers of consciousness you experience. You are all of this. Each moment in life, you experience the outer world, through your senses, according to the level or lens through which you are looking. If you are looking at the physical part, then your focus is on the interaction and harmony between the different facets of the physicality that you have. If you look at the meaning in yourself, then you may find subtler aspects of yourself. If you are constantly relating what you experience now with what you did in the past, in order to make sense out of it, you will see that you are a creature who always wants to make sense out of what impinges upon it. We are all caught in this state of trying to balance, to bring equilibrium, to relate so as to maintain ongoingness. We all move according to a certain hierarchy of needs. We want to maintain safety, security, well-being, health and so on. Until such a time that you want to maintain an inner equanimity or joy, which is really what is calling all the time from within ourselves. We are all seekers of bliss. We are all seekers of the infinite, of the Absolute, but we have to deal with the relative, because if you deny the relative, you will be denied the subtler. These levels of consciousness can be imagined as spheres within spheres. Again, you are what you make of yourself. If you say, \u201cI am this role or that role,\u201d then - for that moment - you are. If you focus on the higher within you - Pure Consciousness - then you are beyond the zone of limitations associated with mind, reasoning, intellect and all the other things which ensure the continuity of this life. Most people seem to seek meaning in material things. Why? We\u2019re all looking for the ultimate qualities: power, wealth, longevity, permanency etc. We start with the gross, material, limited side of existence because that is what we are familiar with. I want power, but this desire operates in a field where power - or its duration - is limited. This world, and my activities and interactions within it, is my kindergarten. This starting point draws me towards the source of all power, all wealth, all ability, capability, and knowledge. The material is a transient reality - nothing lasts here. Those who love beauty try constantly to maintain it, though it is not maintainable in that particular fashion. We seek beauty in beautiful objects, but - in Reality - we are caught by the love of Beauty itself, not a beautiful thing ! It is a good start, but soon you will get frustrated, disappointed and depressed. This is a key to awakening to the fact that this zone is not meant for a constant, permanent realisation of Perfect Beauty. As soon as you have the most beautiful flower, it starts wilting and recycling. Why do people keep repeating material quests then? We always go on repeating until such time that we see the futility of wanting to preserve a thing. You realise it is not the \u2018thinginess\u2019 you were after; it is the meaning behind the thing. It is not money you were after, it is the ability to satisfy all your needs and desires. You are after permanent power, ability, knowledge, beauty and majesty. You are essentially in an impermanent zone seeking the permanent. So, you are doing the right thing, but in the wrong domain. It\u2019s not attainable in a world of change! You get a modicum of security, and some degree of health, but there is no such thing as perfect health. The moment you are born is the moment you begin to move closer to death. The entire business is about the higher wanting to be seen and acknowledged by the lower. In other words, God loved to be known, so He created. In a fashion, all of us are worshipping at that altar of perfection. You live by the constancy of being pulled towards that perfection, without being able to attain it in any durable sense in this zone of change. This is the paradox that we need to resolve in life: that you want the permanent and boundless, yet you are constantly experiencing the bounded and limited. So why are so many people trapped looking for features rather than the meaning? It\u2019s the mind. The mind is an incredibly important connector, because it is a gallery of my past experiences. Whenever I see, hear or touch something, the circuitry in my mind relates it to what is stored from the past so that I might make sense out of it. However, it\u2019s all relative; it\u2019s all about comparing, and we get used to this. Eventually, the world ends up being your mind. Yet the source of the world is more than the mind. The mind is an instrument meant to deal with the mundane, rational, basic things: what time is it, where I am going and so on. You are not the mind! The mind is only an aspect of you. Nor are you just the intellect, or the higher reasoning, which is also just an aspect of you. In truth, you are a boundless light. It is your soul that is giving sentience and energy to all the different facets you experience. You are all of these, put together with a certain priority. That priority is boundless, infinite. This is why we love the attributes of the Garden: the boundlessness of it, being care-free, content and all the other facets of existence within the Divine Precinct. We start in this kindergarten with the limitations of the body, the senses, and the mind until we realise that all of our experiences in this world are a reflection of a permanent light within you, which is boundless. The boundless can only be fathomed, experienced, known through the bounded. You can never know the sun simply by glaring right at it. However, you can see its effect by observing the stars and the moon and the earth and its dependency on the sun. Yet the sun is not affected by all these things. Neither is God. He is not affected by my cursing, or my being happy or unhappy, yet He is the cause of all that appears. The moon does not know that the sun is the origin of its light, but it responds to it. If I respond fully, I have the added capacity (unlike the moon, which lacks sentience) to know what is making me desire. Hence the great hadith that God was a hidden treasure and loved to be known, therefore He created. We are all created to know that so-called Unknown, by its effects. These effects are multi-layered, and one of them is this box of the mind which traps so many, driving them to illicit means to go beyond its causal limits, which give us no lasting joy. Is that then the design - that most people will be trapped in this limited existence? The design is layered with infinite levels and I am according to which design I follow. The Divine decrees, or patterns, are already set. If I follow a certain pattern, I will come to that particular end. If I follow another pattern, I will come to another end. My life and experiences are a mixture of my own movement and actions, and the decrees that determine the final event. I have freedom to act at a certain level, but I am not free to determine my destiny. If I act with the intention of moving toward higher knowledge, then I will eventually reach it, by It, through exclusion of other knowledge and information. It is a question of displacement. Most people get used to the habit of the familiar and so remain with their mind. The design, or the map of existence, is that each moment seeks its stability. If I am used to a certain pattern of thought, action, or transaction then I find comfort in it. This is a small reflection of the pattern of the soul, which is forever at ease and in comfort. The soul is forever, so it has the routine of foreverness, which I try to duplicate in everyday life. This is why we love repetitive routines; they mimic ongoingness. There are two paradoxical issues constantly: we have an aspect which is worldly and limited and - within it, behind it, before it, and after it - there is the energising source which is limitless. Once I realise that these two zones are in me, then I am reconciled. Without that full and constant realisation, I am confused by my position between limiting reason and limitless desire. Whatever desire I have - good or bad - will be brought to an end in a worldly setting due to time and space. Yet, if it is joy or love, I want it to be limitless, whereas worldly love or beautiful objects or whatever we pursue is limited, as is my life. In truth, Life itself is limitless, but the way I experience it in a conscious, limited, worldly way gives me the illusion of imprisonment. What about fate? It\u2019s the natural outcome of what you have done and what is around you. If you look at the pattern of existence, there are infinite layers - a kind of endless web - of patterns, which all impinge on each other. Some of them are very gross: if I kick the table, I see it, hear it, and my toe may get injured. If I say something that is hurtful or disrespectful, I also know its effect and can see it generate a response. The same applies to thoughts, and subtler thoughts, and those most secret thoughts until the ultimate: what is in my heart? There are infinite layers of natural laws which govern the entirety of this existence. I may take a certain action, but the ultimate outcome or destiny I experience is not in my hand; only the action is. Therefore, we say that you are as good as your intentions. If your intention is to rediscover that zone within you which gives you the constancy and reliability of perfection, then you will be led to it, by It; by slowly suffering and turning away from the zone of imperfection and chaos. If I want to see the essence of order, I will see it even in the middle of the most chaotic disorder. However, I have no control over the timing of when I will reach that consciousness. I have certain control over what I am doing now, why I am doing it, and what my purpose is. It starts with reasoning, but ends up beyond me. I can\u2019t control the ultimate outcome. People who are not endowed with this understanding become fatalistic. They say, \u201cIt\u2019s not in my hands, it\u2019s in God\u2019s hands.\u201d Yet, certainly, there is something in my hands - my intention and immediate action is in my hands, though the ultimate outcome - which is the result of multiple factors impinging on each other - is not. I may want to cross the road, but a car coming round the corner could be moving faster than expected\u2026 I am not in control of the final outcome of my destiny. If we can have no expectation of an outcome, why act at all? This is where the muddle occurs. Essentially, I want happiness. Happiness means contentment. Contentment means access to a zone in me that is constantly reliable and available and which gives me the thrill and the joy of being alive. What goes wrong is that my mind - because of my past experiences - tells me that my happiness depends on being an executive, with a fancy car, and briefcase, and five secretaries to do my bidding. It is that image which enslaves me, not the love of happiness and contentment and bliss. I have become a prisoner of my mind by mixing up a mental issue with something which is far deeper, in my heart. We all want happiness, but we look for it in a zone which we assume will be the door to it. This is where we go wrong. We assume that a certain kind of relationship will bring us happiness, and so we end up blaming others all the time. I ought to blame myself for having caused this chaos by mixing up an image in my mind with a desire in my heart. How can I find perfection or meaning in moments of severe trauma? We are always seeking within a hierarchy of wellness: at the physical level (to do with actions); the mental and emotional level (to do with meaning and harmony); and the higher level (to do with the essence). Ultimately, we want to be able - at all times - to see through the eye of the essence how everything has got its perfection, even though it may appear as imperfect. This question arises from a state in which you thought your happiness lies in going to a particular place, without reading the total situation to the best of your ability. It is a question of human ignorance, not Divine punishment. You have punished yourself, by your wrong action. We are always punished by what we are doing ourselves. Not because of what we are doing, it is by what we are doing. It is through your own action that you receive the reward or lack of it. At all times, we are trying to maintain equanimity and balance at all these levels. If you believe in one, encompassing Creator, if you believe in God, if you believe in the one-and-only Absoluteness of Reality, then you will see how - from that Essence - the meanings and perfections of the attributes are emitted, manifesting as actions. Actions are only a manifestation of meanings: the chair has only one aspect for people of meaning, which is to do with comfort or ease. Its physicality has a meaning and that meaning also has a higher meaning, in that I want to be comfortable so that I am not nagged by my body or mind so that I can dwell within the zone of the permanent in me. We all love that zone of oblivion, away from limitation. We are all seekers of that permanent, Absolute essence, because it is within us and it is beaming all the time, beckoning us to it. But how do we find this meaning in our shatteredness!? Nature has designed us to grow through appropriate stages and we are driven along the path from the gross to the subtler. This shatteredness you are talking about is a result of me not yielding to the natural program. I have not yielded and have not grown enough: emotionally I am arrested, or spiritually I have not yet evolved enough to realise that anything that happens occurs according to a pattern. I may have inadvertently put myself in that pattern, which is my own ignorance. Every failure is an opportunity for me to realise where I have gone wrong: that is, I have followed my own desires relentlessly without weighing them, without taking counsel, without due consideration. I went into it headlong, so it is my fault. That fault is additional knowledge, but because I am bent on getting an \u201cend product\u201d, which I do not have, I become angry. Anger arises because I have misplaced, or miscalculated, and now I wish to blame everyone else rather than my own miscalculations. In other words, the more I am concerned with an ultimate outcome of simple contentment, the less I will be disappointed. The more I have desires, the more likely it is I will be disappointed. What are the roots of some key aspects of existence: love, hate, knowledge, action, success and failure? Life is entirely based on the energy that we are given to attain desirables, and the desirables change all the time. From a child wanting a sweet, to an artist wanting to create a piece that shows a lot of meaning in one instant. We are driven by the love for attaining such desirables; ending up with passion. To begin with, it is love of this and that in a gross sense, until it becomes all-consuming passion. This implies that there are things that I want to attract to myself and things I want to repel from myself. So, using the example of a highway code or map, life is first based on the ways of nature which I must be able to read correctly. If I constantly use this road, then I am likely to have repeated accidents. If I am going to the marketplace, where there is so much competition for money, I ought to see that there will be more cheating, more lies and a greater reduction of human value, because it is all after some abstract entity called money which opens doors in people\u2019s minds to power. If I am driving on these roads and don\u2019t know the map properly then - even if I have a good driving license and am a good driver - I will cause a lot of accidents by making mistakes. So, you need to know the map well! Read the atlas and its codes. Then, you need to be a good driver and follow the code, which is where religions and the prophetic teachings come in. You want to follow within the boundaries, because you don\u2019t want to cause additional uncertainties in an already-uncertain situation. Once you know the map, have become a skilled driver, and have a roadworthy car, you need awareness of the overall conditions around you: is there a hurricane predicted? All this so we might maintain different levels of safety. We want basic health, then a clear mind, and a pure heart. Essentially, your soul is housed in your heart, which is why we say that you need to purify your heart so that you have access to the essence. Is that self knowledge? The soul emits an infinite array of patterns or programs into you. Autonomically, you will pull your finger away from a candle if it is burning you. It is beyond you; it\u2019s not even mind. It bypasses the circuitry of the conscious mind. Self-knowledge is to know that the higher self does everything, in its own sequence. If you maintain your attention on the lower, then you remain mentally arrested or emotionally childish. You have a certain measure of choice in obstructing the program, not in the program itself. It is already there. That\u2019s why we talk about submission. Submission is not an inert or a negative approach to any situation. It has to do with the fact that you must not allow your own diversions and distractions to stop this magnificent program from unfolding in you. The purpose of your existence is to know the Source of existence, and that Source is in you. Your access to the Divine, to God, is through your soul. So it\u2019s not so much seeking as it is being found? Precisely! You have already been founded by that foundation. You have to let go and yield to it, rather than obstruct it by your own desires, which may be quite legitimate. However, it may be that the timing is wrong, or the arena in which you are looking is wrong. We are all looking for the right thing, but often in the wrong way.","title":"Changing You"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk1/#what-am-i","text":"Essentially, you are what you make yourself.

The soul is forever, so it has the routine of foreverness, which I try to duplicate in everyday life. This is why we love repetitive routines; they mimic ongoingness. There are two paradoxical issues constantly: we have an aspect which is worldly and limited and - within it, behind it, before it, and after it - there is the energising source which is limitless. Once I realise that these two zones are in me, then I am reconciled. Without that full and constant realisation, I am confused by my position between limiting reason and limitless desire. Whatever desire I have - good or bad - will be brought to an end in a worldly setting due to time and space. Yet, if it is joy or love, I want it to be limitless, whereas worldly love or beautiful objects or whatever we pursue is limited, as is my life. In truth, Life itself is limitless, but the way I experience it in a conscious, limited, worldly way gives me the illusion of imprisonment.","title":"Is that then the design - that most people will be trapped in this limited existence?"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk1/#what-about-fate","text":"It\u2019s the natural outcome of what you have done and what is around you. If you look at the pattern of existence, there are infinite layers - a kind of endless web - of patterns, which all impinge on each other. Some of them are very gross: if I kick the table, I see it, hear it, and my toe may get injured. If I say something that is hurtful or disrespectful, I also know its effect and can see it generate a response. The same applies to thoughts, and subtler thoughts, and those most secret thoughts until the ultimate: what is in my heart? There are infinite layers of natural laws which govern the entirety of this existence. I may take a certain action, but the ultimate outcome or destiny I experience is not in my hand; only the action is. Therefore, we say that you are as good as your intentions. If your intention is to rediscover that zone within you which gives you the constancy and reliability of perfection, then you will be led to it, by It; by slowly suffering and turning away from the zone of imperfection and chaos. If I want to see the essence of order, I will see it even in the middle of the most chaotic disorder. However, I have no control over the timing of when I will reach that consciousness. I have certain control over what I am doing now, why I am doing it, and what my purpose is. It starts with reasoning, but ends up beyond me. I can\u2019t control the ultimate outcome. People who are not endowed with this understanding become fatalistic.

To begin with, it is love of this and that in a gross sense, until it becomes all-consuming passion. This implies that there are things that I want to attract to myself and things I want to repel from myself. So, using the example of a highway code or map, life is first based on the ways of nature which I must be able to read correctly. If I constantly use this road, then I am likely to have repeated accidents. If I am going to the marketplace, where there is so much competition for money, I ought to see that there will be more cheating, more lies and a greater reduction of human value, because it is all after some abstract entity called money which opens doors in people\u2019s minds to power. If I am driving on these roads and don\u2019t know the map properly then - even if I have a good driving license and am a good driver - I will cause a lot of accidents by making mistakes. So, you need to know the map well! Read the atlas and its codes. Then, you need to be a good driver and follow the code, which is where religions and the prophetic teachings come in. You want to follow within the boundaries, because you don\u2019t want to cause additional uncertainties in an already-uncertain situation.

This would imply that there is, within us, the infinity of all things. Yet, what most of us experience is the opposite of all the glorious and blissful attributes of the Almighty.\u201d What is the nature of the power which drives the individual in this world? We experience life always through change, movement, temperature and so on. We experience light through its shadow. Pure light cannot be perceived, except through rainbows. We experience the ever-present, eternal light of the Divine through the attributes which emanate from it. Everything that we experience which is subject to time and space is moving from one end to another; from one opposite to another. Good to bad; up to down; wakefulness to sleep - oscillating constantly. Everything we experience is images on the screen of non-change. What drives us is the love of that Absolute non-change. The fuel of any movement or desire is love, though these desires may occur at a multitude of different levels within the hierarchy of life. The love for good health; for a clear mind; for beauty; for perfection of whatever we witness in the Garden; for bringing together a harmony in which - if I do the right thing at the right time in the right way - the right result comes. We are fueled or motivated by an infinite hierarchy of love and passion, ending with love for Love, by Love, unto Love. In that state, everything you see is a manifestation of the original Essence, although it may - in appearance - seem far removed from it. For instance, a lump of steel is light, modified and hardened. This is because there is light within each atom, which is itself nothing other than bits of light whizzing around other bits of light. However, it has been structured, restructured and modified so that it appears hard and solid. Solidity is a facet of light, and we are essentially made of that Light of lights, before its fragmentation into the colours of the rainbow. We contain within us that essence which is a reflection of the Divine Essence. We are both divine and subjected to constant change, struggle and desires. It\u2019s together! You cannot deny the fact that you will always have needs. Nor can you deny the truth that you are always seeking to be without needs, at the same time. This is the paradox: here we are caught in time and space, searching, seeking, desiring and worshipping at the altar of that which is beyond time and space, and is the source and cause of time and space. Together! Every one of us contains a soul, which has within it a pattern which is cosmic, and yet is simultaneously subject to the physicality and changes of this world. What distracts us from this? Other shadows. Impinging shadows. Constantly changing shadows and demands, from the physical to the mental to the spiritual to the environmental and our relationships. It\u2019s a constant interplay of attraction and repulsion to bring us back into equilibrium. If we are unaware of this, we end up in chaos, not knowing the wood from the trees, or what our priority really is. If we realise that - at all times - we are seeking access to the zone of equanimity and constancy within us, then all of these distractions actually become an enhancement for arrival. Could you explain why we have this apparent schizophrenia? You see, light will only be shown, and its qualities known, by the shadow it casts. As we know, light behaves like both a particle and a wave. The photon is a specific entity with a set duration and, therefore, a \u201cdeath\u201d. The wave continues forever. The same pattern applies to individuals: an aspect of us dies and an aspect of us carries on. It is the frequency . If the frequency of the so-called I is synchronised with the eternal in me, then I am saved from my lower self and all the shadows which occur outside and inside. Therefore, the entire business of maturity moves you from the physical and material to the subtler until you realise that what you were seeking has been seeking you. Really, God has been seeking you! He wants to be known and shown and adored, so you are adoring all these qualities. The conflict you refer to revolves around the fact that an aspect of you seems to be dying and yet, you want to prolong anything that is desirable. Here, a part of you is dying and a part of you wants to live forever. A part of you is caught by the shadow and a part of you wants to be free. There is this dichotomy and, unless you resolve it, personal conflict becomes societal conflict. In truth, you are the centre of your universe. If you have not, in every way, defined it, known it, seen it, and mapped it you will see others as threats and that is the basis of conflict and war. There is an inherent inner conflict around that fact that you want to attain power and yet you know that you will never attain sufficient power. You want constant ease and yet you know you will never attain it, because your body constantly has different demands. There is an inherent apparent conflict within us which is then projected on a societal level. Until it is seen that this conflict is only a shadow indicating the light, we cannot resolve it. If you see that the shadow is only a result of the light, then there is no conflict. Will we really see that shadows are caused by light? Aren\u2019t people just always fixed and focussed on the shadow? Yes, it often happens. It\u2019s not your birthright to be able to transcend the shadow, or transcend your mind. It\u2019s something you have to work at. The same way we work at outer skills - whether it is a language or a profession or whatever - we also have to work at the skill of discerning the mind from the intellect, from the light behind them both. So, it is true that most people get caught in this, and that\u2019s just what it is. Now, the truth is that any intelligent person who reflects, meditates, and looks at the meaning behind all this will reach a point where they discover that we are all seekers of the same thing. We are seekers of inner ease, contentment, understanding, knowledge and self-reliance, rather than the lower self becoming an obstacle. Shadows are relative. Everything in this life is relative: my experiences, my needs, my desires, my relationships all change. What I wanted when I was six is very different from what I wanted when I was fifty. What you want in the morning is not the same as what you desire in the afternoon. The shadows are constant changes that are reflected by, and known because of, a screen within me which never changes. I know that the present pain may pass quickly, or that this relationship may take longer for me to adjust or get out of or suffer from. You already know, within yourself, a certain hierarchy or time sequence, by relating to that zone of constancy which is the closest to the Light in you. You have Pure Light or Consciousness in you, manifesting as multifaceted consciousness: consciousness of your body, of your mind, of your heart, of your health, of the others, of the environment and so on. But then there is this Pure Consciousness. The more you are tuned to that, the less you are disturbed or distracted by outer changes. That is why, the more there is outer change, the more you need to enhance your inner access to the non-change. It is the way of nature: it is warning you that there is excess in the outer which needs to be balanced by access to the inner. But we get carried away, which is the meaning of dis-ease: disease, you are sick if not synchronised with the totality. You do not deny the outer change, but if you get caught by it completely you are denying yourself that inner non-change. This is what causes us to be labelled as too materialistic or worldly. There is nothing wrong with the world! What is wrong is my relationship to it. There is nothing wrong with things, it is my obsession with things that makes me suffer. Could you give us an example of light and shadow, and how it works? Light manifests in a multitude of desirable qualities. Let\u2019s take knowledge. Knowledge emanates from the essential Light of lights, which is the divine essence. The shadow of knowledge is ignorance and we are all programmed not to want ignorance. Ignorance is the nature of the lower, but I am driven by my desire to know - I want to know! - therefore that shadow becomes a key to the courtyard of light, which manifests in this particular case as knowledge. The same idea applies to hearing: it is a virtue to be able to hear and a vice to be deaf. Therefore I get a hearing aid to turn from the shadow of that vice to the light which has caused it. So, all vices are shadows of virtues. I suffer from vices so that I turn to the virtue that has, if you like, produced the vice as a by-product, and has programmed me to make that turn. It is already done! The work is done in that one of the divine attributes in the Ever-Generous, the Ever-Merciful. Now, the basic lower nature of the self is meanness, but I am also programmed wanting to have generosity. My awareness of my meanness (or the meanness of others) becomes the means by which I see it as a vice to turn away from. The suffering from that vice can be a big incentive and drive towards the virtue of generosity. All of these higher attributes are within the heart. If I only adore them more, I will automatically turn away from their shadows, which are the opposite and negative emotions. Somebody could be generous, but harbour ill intentions. Does that mean that generosity itself can become a shadow? There is no such thing as a constant person or character: it\u2019s about what you do. You may act generously, but it is a small, little reflection of the ever-present, boundless generosity that is emanating from the Essence, from God. So, you have simply synchronised yourself with a little bit of a tiny little reflection of that. Which is why we say, \u201cHe is an illumined person\u201d or, \u201cHe is full of light.\u201d All it means is that that person is acting in a manner which reflects occasions of the attributes, which are the Ever-Generous, the Magnanimous, the Forgiving, the Loving and so on. There is no such thing as a generous person, but if you exercise generosity all the time, then you will - in a way - be given that label because you have been constantly acting in a way which is considered generous. Which really just means giving that which does not belong to you anyway. What did you have when you were born? What do you have when you leave this world? In between, we are trying our best to enact and reflect the perfection which is within us. We are totally, in every way and at all times, worshipping at that altar, because we love total generosity, unconditional love, boundless knowledge, and all the other attributes which we all know are beckoning us. The way we go to them is by turning away from their opposites, which are the shadows. Could you give us some examples of what shadows mean ? Greed is of the lower self, love of the lower self, and we start with that. If you are not greedy, you will not find its opposite, which is unconditional generosity. There needs to be progress, and for that we need guides, help, and reflections so that we can groom the character. The nature of the lower self is to be greedy and mean, calling everything to itself and dispelling everything it doesn\u2019t desire, which changes all the time. What is the meaning of suffering? Suffering is nothing other than going for a zone or an activity that does not last, nor does it give me contentment. Suffering is a misplaced orientation. A journey - if you like - into the wrong cul-de-sac, which comes to nothing. I am programmed not wanting to suffer, so I have to take to the original pattern which is already within me. Suffering in this sense is the prelude to the Divine Offering, a call from the higher in me to abandon and turn away from the lower within me. We all can be mean, we all can be deaf or turn a blind eye, but - equally - if you are given to constant reference to the higher in you, you don\u2019t want to be mean. Because you want others to be generous to you and you know the outer world is, in truth, a reflection of your inner world. The more you are generous - truly, unconditionally - the more you will find that the world is generous to you. In fact, we bring about - through mirroring - the outer situation to show us our own inner situation. There is perfect Mercy and balance in life. You reap what you sow\u2026 And hope? Hope will continue forever! Hope implies arrival at the point in which you already are, without knowing it. Ultimately, hope implies knowledge of the ultimate within you that has driven you, in every way and at all times. But you and I have not responded sufficiently, because of our distractions and because of our illusion of freedom, which misleads me to believe that I can do what I want or am empowered in any way I care to imagine. All of these aspects of our experience are reflections of the higher. So, my hope increases as I refer more and more to the higher in me. Eventually, I go beyond hope. Hope comes fairly early on in the ladder of self-discovery and self-enlightenment, because it is an aspiration, or it was faith. Eventually, that faith becomes knowledge , that I know I am - totally, in every way - guided by the One and only Light within me, not misguided by the many shadows. Then you are consistent. We are all seeking consistency and reliability. The reason is that there is an inner core constantly beaming and bombarding us with that pattern or frequency. We want to be tuned to a zone that is ever there, which is why we also love trust, though most of us end up completely distorted and confused because of mistrust. I trust in him or her, but these are only tiny reflections of trust in the eternal zone of trust, which is why it is so important for parents to allow children to trust them: you can\u2019t change constantly. Trust is part of Lordship ( rububiyya ) and tarbiyah : to bring them up. To realise that there is a zone that is forever trustworthy, which is the divine zone in you, or your soul. All our hopes, faith, and trust lead us to the ultimate precinct, which is within us. The closer you get to it, the more you will find its light and reality and effulgence. The further you are away from it, the more you are caught in its outer manifestations, which can be hard and physical and material. What is the impact of our environment - our upbringing, conditioning and traumas - on our ability to turn towards the light? I don\u2019t think anyone is immune to how they were nurtured, no matter who. An ordinary person, a mediocre bourgeois person, or a prophet: no-one is immune to shadows. Shadows, indeed, are the manifestation of the original Light; they are how it expresses Mercy. What matters most is that passion and desire for the original Light and the ultimate Absoluteness behind all the relativity. If that passion drives you, then the shadows will not affect you. In fact, they begin to enhance the light. It depends on your inner situation, which changes according to many factors. Of course we are subject to genetic imprints and of course we are subject to those early months in the womb and our first experiences of this world. Everyone is subject to their environment. We are both nature and nurture. But, if you truly have that passion for the eternal, then the eternal - which is always eternal and always there, manifesting as well in the changing - will reveal itself. Then you know the eternal and you do not deny the changes. You do not deny the pain; you do not deny the anguish, but they will not leave a big imprint on you. It sounds like we should pity those who don\u2019t suffer? Truly, absolutely. That\u2019s why people in a coma don\u2019t suffer [laughs]. Or people who have completely gone mad: they don\u2019t have any foundation in rationality, or reasoning or balance. We have to start with that: we have to be reasonable and give evidence, until such time that you realise that all these changes had higher meaning behind them, and within that meaning was the same light and that is what unifies the cosmos. Which is why, as I said earlier, conflict comes by two and unity is the foundation of the so-called conflict. So, we can connect with - we can have sympathy, empathy and love - by going to the original love, by going to the One behind the two. Otherwise, everything is confusing, because each has its own fingerprint, which is distracting. This outer identity actually hides the same, inner entity. That is why we say, \u201cWherever you turn, there is the face of God.\u201d Wherever you turn is that Essence. What is the cause of guilt, sorrow, and contentment? Again, the great natural design. We are given this apparent freedom to act: I can now act in a manner which is conducive, or one which is destructive. Guilt is the difference between what I have done and what I could have done had I been fully present and taking reference from the constant inner zone. If I had referred to the higher in me, I would have acted differently. So, guilt is only a measure of the difference between what I did in a hurry or absent-mindedly, with what I could have done with not only presence of mind, but also presence of heart. This is because we love to be constantly doing appropriately within that moment\u2019s totality. We want to act correctly, all the time. And it changes all the time! \u201cCorrectly\u201d meaning in a manner that you could not have done better had you had more time and opportunity to reflect upon your action. So, you are living the moment fully. * If you are living the moment fully, you have lived eternally. * How can we groom the self and be free from the ego? You can never be free of the ego totally: the ego is an indicator of the light that has cast it. We must not renounce the ego, we must sublimate our lower tendencies and bypass them by virtue of the plan and program we are given within us which makes us suffer from such tendencies and therefore turn to the opposite, where the perfection lies. You are never free of the shadows. You won\u2019t exist in this body anymore. But it becomes so unimportant. It becomes like the paintings of those pointillists: just a tiny little dot with no big impact. You cannot free yourself from the shadow, nor can you free yourself from the Original Light in you. But that Original Light is the freeing agent, because it is free in itself. Your real nature - your higher nature - is eternally free. Your other nature, worldly nature, human nature, identifiable nature - your fingerprint - is caught in specificity. It is definable. The definable actually alludes to the non-definable. The limited betrays, shows, points to the non-limited. Then it becomes far easier for you to groom the self. I have to move though, which requires mobility at different levels: intentional mobility, mental mobility, physical mobility and, of course, spiritual mobility. In the end, I have to admit that I came into this world with no claim, then I can also leave with no claim. All that is happening in the meantime is for me to discover the ultimate gift of the eternal Light, the eternal Life and Its perfections which are here with me! I have to yield to that in order to attain the fruit of this existence, otherwise I will be chasing these shadows all the time. We all seek limitless wealth, because there is the limitless zone of the Ever-Wealthy in you and you can never attain that. Knowing this, you become satisfied with limitation. You say, \u201cOf course! This is enough for me.\u201d Then modesty sets in. Otherwise, the lower self mimics the higher self and wants boundless bounty, which cannot be because this world is based on limitations. Therefore, the conflict. An aspect of me wants everything, and another aspect has within it the knowledge of everything. So, if I tune to the higher in me, then the outer will not make such a big impact upon me, like those people who jumped out the 90 th story window because they lost a fraction of their wealth when share prices plummeted. That is a madness which arises from looking for wealth in the zone where wealth is limited. Knowledge is limited here. Yet, we do not denounce the shadows; we denounce the forgetfulness that the light is constantly there, producing these changing shadows. So, I just need to change my perspective, from one which tries to make sense out of the shadows to one which lets the eternal Light show how all these shadows are - at the end of the day - not self-empowered. They are all dependent on that ever-present Divine energy, which is the source of all love, of itself, by itself. So the trick is take the limits and limit them even further? Precisely. Accept the limitations, then you will be accepted by the limitless which is in you. Recognise the zone of the limited domain, and the domain of the limitless has already claimed you. Potentially, we are all limitless. Potentially, we are all in the divine precinct. But we experience life - to begin with - in a very strange, constantly shifting, changing, limited world. So, the limited world is created by the limitless Creator, Who is within it at all levels: essence, meanings, attributes and forms. Transcendence implies accepting all of this, while allowing yourself access to another zone in you that is beyond the limitations of the mind. You do not become another entity; you are the same. All that happens is that your focus has changed and shifted a bit more towards the potential in you. So you have realised the potential in you. Therefore, it is self-realised! It\u2019s not a big thing, it is the most natural thing to do. It\u2018s not a strange, mystical phenomena; it is the most natural thing to attain for everyone, because it has attained us! So we have to yield to it.","title":"Light and Shadows"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk2/#what-is-the-nature-of-the-power-which-drives-the-individual-in-this-world","text":"We experience life always through change, movement, temperature and so on.

The love for good health; for a clear mind; for beauty; for perfection of whatever we witness in the Garden; for bringing together a harmony in which - if I do the right thing at the right time in the right way - the right result comes. We are fueled or motivated by an infinite hierarchy of love and passion, ending with love for Love, by Love, unto Love. In that state, everything you see is a manifestation of the original Essence, although it may - in appearance - seem far removed from it. For instance, a lump of steel is light, modified and hardened. This is because there is light within each atom, which is itself nothing other than bits of light whizzing around other bits of light. However, it has been structured, restructured and modified so that it appears hard and solid. Solidity is a facet of light, and we are essentially made of that Light of lights, before its fragmentation into the colours of the rainbow. We contain within us that essence which is a reflection of the Divine Essence. We are both divine and subjected to constant change, struggle and desires. It\u2019s together! You cannot deny the fact that you will always have needs. Nor can you deny the truth that you are always seeking to be without needs, at the same time. This is the paradox: here we are caught in time and space, searching, seeking, desiring and worshipping at the altar of that which is beyond time and space, and is the source and cause of time and space. Together! Every one of us contains a soul, which has within it a pattern which is cosmic, and yet is simultaneously subject to the physicality and changes of this world.","title":"What is the nature of the power which drives the individual in this world?"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk2/#what-distracts-us-from-this","text":"Other shadows.

As we know, light behaves like both a particle and a wave. The photon is a specific entity with a set duration and, therefore, a \u201cdeath\u201d. The wave continues forever. The same pattern applies to individuals: an aspect of us dies and an aspect of us carries on. It is the frequency . If the frequency of the so-called I is synchronised with the eternal in me, then I am saved from my lower self and all the shadows which occur outside and inside. Therefore, the entire business of maturity moves you from the physical and material to the subtler until you realise that what you were seeking has been seeking you. Really, God has been seeking you! He wants to be known and shown and adored, so you are adoring all these qualities. The conflict you refer to revolves around the fact that an aspect of you seems to be dying and yet, you want to prolong anything that is desirable. Here, a part of you is dying and a part of you wants to live forever. A part of you is caught by the shadow and a part of you wants to be free. There is this dichotomy and, unless you resolve it, personal conflict becomes societal conflict. In truth, you are the centre of your universe. If you have not, in every way, defined it, known it, seen it, and mapped it you will see others as threats and that is the basis of conflict and war. There is an inherent inner conflict around that fact that you want to attain power and yet you know that you will never attain sufficient power. You want constant ease and yet you know you will never attain it, because your body constantly has different demands. There is an inherent apparent conflict within us which is then projected on a societal level. Until it is seen that this conflict is only a shadow indicating the light, we cannot resolve it. If you see that the shadow is only a result of the light, then there is no conflict.","title":"Could you explain why we have this apparent schizophrenia?"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk2/#will-we-really-see-that-shadows-are-caused-by-light-arent-people-just-always-fixed-and-focussed-on-the-shadow","text":"Yes, it often happens. It\u2019s not your birthright to be able to transcend the shadow, or transcend your mind. It\u2019s something you have to work at. The same way we work at outer skills - whether it is a language or a profession or whatever - we also have to work at the skill of discerning the mind from the intellect, from the light behind them both. So, it is true that most people get caught in this, and that\u2019s just what it is. Now, the truth is that any intelligent person who reflects, meditates, and looks at the meaning behind all this will reach a point where they discover that we are all seekers of the same thing. We are seekers of inner ease, contentment, understanding, knowledge and self-reliance, rather than the lower self becoming an obstacle. Shadows are relative. Everything in this life is relative: my experiences, my needs, my desires, my relationships all change. What I wanted when I was six is very different from what I wanted when I was fifty. What you want in the morning is not the same as what you desire in the afternoon. The shadows are constant changes that are reflected by, and known because of, a screen within me which never changes. I know that the present pain may pass quickly, or that this relationship may take longer for me to adjust or get out of or suffer from. You already know, within yourself, a certain hierarchy or time sequence, by relating to that zone of constancy which is the closest to the Light in you. You have Pure Light or Consciousness in you, manifesting as multifaceted consciousness: consciousness of your body, of your mind, of your heart, of your health, of the others, of the environment and so on. But then there is this Pure Consciousness. The more you are tuned to that, the less you are disturbed or distracted by outer changes. That is why, the more there is outer change, the more you need to enhance your inner access to the non-change. It is the way of nature: it is warning you that there is excess in the outer which needs to be balanced by access to the inner. But we get carried away, which is the meaning of dis-ease: disease, you are sick if not synchronised with the totality. You do not deny the outer change, but if you get caught by it completely you are denying yourself that inner non-change. This is what causes us to be labelled as too materialistic or worldly. There is nothing wrong with the world! What is wrong is my relationship to it. There is nothing wrong with things, it is my obsession with things that makes me suffer.","title":"Will we really see that shadows are caused by light?

Let\u2019s take knowledge. Knowledge emanates from the essential Light of lights, which is the divine essence. The shadow of knowledge is ignorance and we are all programmed not to want ignorance. Ignorance is the nature of the lower, but I am driven by my desire to know - I want to know! - therefore that shadow becomes a key to the courtyard of light, which manifests in this particular case as knowledge. The same idea applies to hearing: it is a virtue to be able to hear and a vice to be deaf. Therefore I get a hearing aid to turn from the shadow of that vice to the light which has caused it. So, all vices are shadows of virtues. I suffer from vices so that I turn to the virtue that has, if you like, produced the vice as a by-product, and has programmed me to make that turn. It is already done! The work is done in that one of the divine attributes in the Ever-Generous, the Ever-Merciful. Now, the basic lower nature of the self is meanness, but I am also programmed wanting to have generosity. My awareness of my meanness (or the meanness of others) becomes the means by which I see it as a vice to turn away from. The suffering from that vice can be a big incentive and drive towards the virtue of generosity. All of these higher attributes are within the heart. If I only adore them more, I will automatically turn away from their shadows, which are the opposite and negative emotions.","title":"Could you give us an example of light and shadow, and how it works?"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk2/#somebody-could-be-generous-but-harbour-ill-intentions-does-that-mean-that-generosity-itself-can-become-a-shadow","text":"There is no such thing as a constant person or character: it\u2019s about what you do.

Which is why we say, \u201cHe is an illumined person\u201d or, \u201cHe is full of light.\u201d All it means is that that person is acting in a manner which reflects occasions of the attributes, which are the Ever-Generous, the Magnanimous, the Forgiving, the Loving and so on. There is no such thing as a generous person, but if you exercise generosity all the time, then you will - in a way - be given that label because you have been constantly acting in a way which is considered generous. Which really just means giving that which does not belong to you anyway. What did you have when you were born? What do you have when you leave this world? In between, we are trying our best to enact and reflect the perfection which is within us. We are totally, in every way and at all times, worshipping at that altar, because we love total generosity, unconditional love, boundless knowledge, and all the other attributes which we all know are beckoning us.

Suffering in this sense is the prelude to the Divine Offering, a call from the higher in me to abandon and turn away from the lower within me. We all can be mean, we all can be deaf or turn a blind eye, but - equally - if you are given to constant reference to the higher in you, you don\u2019t want to be mean. Because you want others to be generous to you and you know the outer world is, in truth, a reflection of your inner world. The more you are generous - truly, unconditionally - the more you will find that the world is generous to you.

Hope implies arrival at the point in which you already are, without knowing it. Ultimately, hope implies knowledge of the ultimate within you that has driven you, in every way and at all times. But you and I have not responded sufficiently, because of our distractions and because of our illusion of freedom, which misleads me to believe that I can do what I want or am empowered in any way I care to imagine. All of these aspects of our experience are reflections of the higher. So, my hope increases as I refer more and more to the higher in me. Eventually, I go beyond hope. Hope comes fairly early on in the ladder of self-discovery and self-enlightenment, because it is an aspiration, or it was faith. Eventually, that faith becomes knowledge , that I know I am - totally, in every way - guided by the One and only Light within me, not misguided by the many shadows. Then you are consistent. We are all seeking consistency and reliability. The reason is that there is an inner core constantly beaming and bombarding us with that pattern or frequency. We want to be tuned to a zone that is ever there, which is why we also love trust, though most of us end up completely distorted and confused because of mistrust. I trust in him or her, but these are only tiny reflections of trust in the eternal zone of trust, which is why it is so important for parents to allow children to trust them: you can\u2019t change constantly. Trust is part of Lordship ( rububiyya ) and tarbiyah : to bring them up. To realise that there is a zone that is forever trustworthy, which is the divine zone in you, or your soul. All our hopes, faith, and trust lead us to the ultimate precinct, which is within us. The closer you get to it, the more you will find its light and reality and effulgence.

What matters most is that passion and desire for the original Light and the ultimate Absoluteness behind all the relativity. If that passion drives you, then the shadows will not affect you. In fact, they begin to enhance the light. It depends on your inner situation, which changes according to many factors. Of course we are subject to genetic imprints and of course we are subject to those early months in the womb and our first experiences of this world. Everyone is subject to their environment. We are both nature and nurture. But, if you truly have that passion for the eternal, then the eternal - which is always eternal and always there, manifesting as well in the changing - will reveal itself.

You are never free of the shadows. You won\u2019t exist in this body anymore. But it becomes so unimportant. It becomes like the paintings of those pointillists: just a tiny little dot with no big impact. You cannot free yourself from the shadow, nor can you free yourself from the Original Light in you. But that Original Light is the freeing agent, because it is free in itself. Your real nature - your higher nature - is eternally free. Your other nature, worldly nature, human nature, identifiable nature - your fingerprint - is caught in specificity. It is definable. The definable actually alludes to the non-definable. The limited betrays, shows, points to the non-limited. Then it becomes far easier for you to groom the self. I have to move though, which requires mobility at different levels: intentional mobility, mental mobility, physical mobility and, of course, spiritual mobility. In the end, I have to admit that I came into this world with no claim, then I can also leave with no claim. All that is happening in the meantime is for me to discover the ultimate gift of the eternal Light, the eternal Life and Its perfections which are here with me! I have to yield to that in order to attain the fruit of this existence, otherwise I will be chasing these shadows all the time. We all seek limitless wealth, because there is the limitless zone of the Ever-Wealthy in you and you can never attain that. Knowing this, you become satisfied with limitation. You say, \u201cOf course! This is enough for me.\u201d Then modesty sets in. Otherwise, the lower self mimics the higher self and wants boundless bounty, which cannot be because this world is based on limitations. Therefore, the conflict. An aspect of me wants everything, and another aspect has within it the knowledge of everything. So, if I tune to the higher in me, then the outer will not make such a big impact upon me, like those people who jumped out the 90 th story window because they lost a fraction of their wealth when share prices plummeted. That is a madness which arises from looking for wealth in the zone where wealth is limited. Knowledge is limited here. Yet, we do not denounce the shadows; we denounce the forgetfulness that the light is constantly there, producing these changing shadows. So, I just need to change my perspective, from one which tries to make sense out of the shadows to one which lets the eternal Light show how all these shadows are - at the end of the day - not self-empowered.

So, the limited world is created by the limitless Creator, Who is within it at all levels: essence, meanings, attributes and forms. Transcendence implies accepting all of this, while allowing yourself access to another zone in you that is beyond the limitations of the mind. You do not become another entity; you are the same.

So we have to yield to it.","title":"So the trick is take the limits and limit them even further?"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk3/","text":"\u201cUnderstanding that our world is made up of opposites underscores the importance of choice. It is the exercise of choice in the moment through which we create any outcome, good or bad. When we reach a crossroad, it is indeed useful to be guided by something bigger than ourselves.\u201d What should we be guided by? To start with, the world is not made of opposites. It manifests as opposites. Its essence is One, its attributes all relate to the One, and its physical manifestations are all - in every way - permeated and are living, moving, and changing by the One. So, we seek to be guided by that which is forever reliable. In other words, it is the nature of this reality that it manifests in time and space, but its energising force - its creative governing principle - is from beyond time and space. We need to constantly refer to that zone which is steady, constant, ever-reliable and ever-secure. In other words, God-within-us or the soul. We need to refer to that constantly in order to make sense out of ever-changing situations, all of which draw our attention to our need to choose appropriately so that we always end up in a state of equilibrium and homeostasis. We each need to have some reference point. That is the guidance we seek. We want guidance which is not subject to change, which is not subject to the relative ups and downs. I am subjected constantly, minute-to-minute in each of my senses, to things which change and yet I want to steer a course which gives me that inner constancy so that, in my heart, I am content and happy. Therefore, I need that reference to a zone which is forever reliable, which is what I call the soul. And my access to the soul is through my heart, because the soul dwells in my heart. If the heart is pure, then I have access to it. If it is not, then I am already coloured by my own lenses. What is the relationship between the heart and the soul? The heart provides access to my soul. Soul is, if you like, an abstract energy or a divine zone which is undefinable. My heart is definable. My heart gets tarnished. I get suspicious and I get saddened. Sadness is not in my memory: memory causes sadness. So, my heart is that zone which is between my soul and my higher self, or the intellect. How do you use memory? Well, memory relates to the different layers of consciousness. As a baby, I develop the first layer by seeing the mother, or seeing movement and motion. In time, it becomes more like a bank or vault which contains pictures, and then the meanings of pictures. Thus, when I see something I liked, it immediately triggers off a desire to attain it again. Or, the reverse: I have in my mind something which was disagreeable, which immediately triggers in my mind the meaning of disagreeability . My mind is constantly used in order to steer an existential balance, with reference to that constant point within, but it is - in itself - tricky! Ultimately, my mind is the imprisonment of my higher consciousness. It is the veil of that higher consciousness. I must have a good mind, but then transcend it. I must have a pure heart, and refer to the higher element which is within it. I do not deny the mind, but I must not be constantly subjected to the mind. The intellect also reflects the higher. It reflects the soul. Therefore, it is more rational. It is not subject to my personal emotions. I can refer to you with my intellect, not through my emotions. I have had a different upbringing, different exposures and experiences - as have you - but where we can meet is through intellect, reasoning and - higher than that - through our hearts; which is unconditional love. It is seeing, in each other, one another. What tarnishes the heart? [It may occur when you think you have reached] a point of contentment with the soul but have been deflected. It\u2019s very subtle. It is where I have trusted somebody, and they have let me down, because trust is to do with the soul. It is to do with the higher attributes. So, I was about to trust my soul, I was about to reach\u2026 but I got deflected by trusting the other fellow too long, or too much without letting that stepping stone (of trusting a person) lead me to the trusting zone within me. That is why it gets tarnished . It is more than emotional grief, you see. With the mind, you can easily talk about grief, but this point about tarnishing is too subtle. Where do terms like \u2018personality\u2019 and \u2018character\u2019 fit in? Repetitiveness. If I repeat these patterns, then my personality becomes pessimistic or optimistic, or inward-looking, outward-looking etc. It is the repetitiveness, the constancy, of a certain pattern or a certain style of driving along this map which gives me this label. But it has no permanent reality! If I realise the higher potential within me, I can change. I can say, \u201cMy trait has been this\u201d or \u201cI have short feet,\u201d but it is of no real consequence. I may have been brought up with great difficulty in the ghettos, but it is of no consequence! My mentality now, or my heart, is above the above; it has nothing to do with the \u201cghetto mentality\u201d that I had experienced. Each one of us has that potential. This is where hope is: that you may have started building your layers of consciousness in that domain, but you are - essentially - the highest consciousness, pure consciousness, so it can eradicate, it can override, all of those misfortunes. Is cultivating awareness of the higher within you just a case of clear discernment? We can\u2019t help but choose. And the choice starts with the lower self, in fact. I constantly want to bring forth, or attract, that which I consider desirable and repel that which I consider undesirable. From the beginning, a child does that, as does any grownup. We are all the time trying to bring forth that which we think - at that moment - is good for us and avoid that which we think - at that moment - is bad for us. If you measure the good and the bad in terms of longevity or durability, then you are nearer to the reference of truth and guidance within you. In other words, what is ultimately good for me is to have access to a zone that constantly thrills me and gives me personal contentment and happiness. That is really what is good, without a bad. Every other good can be bad. What is good for me now can be bad for me tomorrow. What is good for a kid can be ridiculous for an adult, and vice versa. Good and bad are relative in themselves. There is no such thing as permanent good or permanent bad, except One Absolute Good. That is the knowledge of the Light which permeates all other lights and all other shadows. That is Absolute Good. If my following the good leads me to that, then I am on the right path. If it does not, then I am following what is transient and am just moving from one exercise to another, from one project to another and - at the end - is disappointment. Can you define the soul? What happens in birth and death? The soul is a reflector of the Divine, Absolute, All-Permeating, All-Encompassing, Eternal Light. If you like, it carries the same essence as the Lord, as the Creator, but - if you like - in a more containable, confinable, definable fashion. We don\u2019t know its nature, because within it lies the programs of all nature, and nurture! It is like a battery that is self-charging, which is within both me and you. Though I refer to it as \u201cmy soul\u201d, in reality - I am His, because He is the governing principle. This is where, again, there is a paradox. It is my soul, and yet It governs me. If I yield to It, then I am full of that Light. If I don\u2019t, then I am only good as a reflector of how far my shadows stretch from It. The perfect patterns of all of the desirable attributes are contained within my soul. I as an ego manifest Its shadows. Through turning away from those shadows, I am turning towards my soul. All that I have is a soul! So the soul is an immortal entity? Sure. At the point of death, what remains is the extent of these veils that I have lifted, by courtesy of the soul, and therefore I lead into the next world according to the condition in which I have left this world. So-called resurrection occurs according to how I have gone into the next world. It is like a bulb with a lamp shade around it. The lamp shade is my ego: my veils, memories, and value system. The more transparent those are, the less there is to account for in the next life, or all the other things which come with the horrors of being questioned. If we think of the soul as being ongoing, why are we afraid of death? Because we have not yet got familiar with the ongoingness of the soul. We have become familiar with the transitory nature of this world. I have been so familiar with, and accustomed to, causality and the changing world and I have grown clever in terms of manipulating it - and everybody else in site as well [laughs] - that I have neglected being absorbed and guided and led by soul. If I am led by my soul, I will never be misled, nor will I mislead. That also brings up the question of leadership. If I am not led by the source of leadership in me, what qualification do I have to lead others? I will simply mislead them. Does this relate to the paradox that you are in this world and not of this world? Sure. We are in this world in order to see how it reflects what is beyond it; beyond time and space. This world is subject to change and we are seeking the world from which it emanated, which is not subject to change. One entity, One essence; manifesting in infinite varieties. Varieties are interesting to begin with if they lead me to the meaning behind them. And that meaning leads me to One essence. All of the meanings, all of the Divine attributes converge to an Essence. The Divine attributes of Ever-Forgiving, the Ever-Knowing, the Ever-Loving, the Ever-Merciful all lead to One essence, from which all the varieties of great attributes which we adore have emanated and which sustains them. We can\u2019t talk about God or Allah. We can talk only about the attributes, which we know - within ourselves - are desirable. Most great enlightened beings, prophets and messengers, have referred to this. \u201cBe ready for that transformation into the next zone of consciousness,\u201d they have said. Be ready to die in terms of transcending your senses and your mind and your memory and this contained, confined, four-dimensional world. Which means: be willing to go beyond this limitation. It doesn\u2019t mean that you renounce this world, or that you try in any way to avoid it. You just see the meaning of it - that alludes to something boundless, limitless - and you enter into that zone through deep reflectiveness, abandonment, submission, and emptiness. This is what we all love! In fact, holidays - and every other attempt we make to experience leisure - are about entering into a zone that is beyond this limiting factor of cause and effect; the up and the down which we are naturally, biologically subjected to. To die before you die means you are at the zone of the Ever-Living, or with that consciousness in you. Do I, as an individual, then contain infinity? This is why I said you are in this world, but not of this world. You are of an infinite, boundless dimension, caught in the prison of this world. But once you realise the qualities of the prison warden, then you also love this world. This world will only be an indication of the world beyond. It is not to be resented. It is simply not to be attached to, because you cannot hold it. You cannot fix this world, except in a camera or on film - which is why everyone likes to put on their \u201cbest face\u201d when they are photographed. So a photograph is a lie, betraying the truth. It\u2019s a lie in that it\u2019s no longer: you are no longer that. But it betrays - or flashes - a momentary truth about how, in that instant, you stretched your mouth into a smile. What is the relationship between the individual and the collective? We are always looking for mirrors. Initially, the parents are mirrors and, if they are cracked, then the children are also cracked and we are going to produce a horrendous future generation. This is why the reliability, availability, presence, and concern of the mother matters so much. Then comes the love of the father, and then this circle of concern widens out into the society at large. We need that mirroring until you discover that reflectiveness is within you. You find that there is a constant companion in you that reflects you! It will also help to have a teacher that you refer to every now and then, when you are at a crossroads. Until you find that that teacher is in you! So you have the constant, perpetual, spontaneous awareness of awareness, and of awareness of awareness of awareness. Which means that you have access to your highest zone of pure awareness, combined with your awareness of something which is contaminated: this particular noise, or that particular voice etc. What is the importance of role models? Is there such a person? Sure. The first role model is usually the mother in that she is reliable (hopefully!) and, when the baby cries, she is there. Which is why there is a very strong bond between the two. Eventually, your role model is he who you know, within yourself, has access constantly to the reliable zone in themselves. In other words, a person who is enlightened, a person who knows that they are functioning in multifaceted ways at multiple levels of consciousness, but essentially always with access to the pure, higher consciousness within. That is why you say, \u201cHe is a reliable teacher.\u201d One description of a great teacher - Baba Farid - was that, \u201cWe have never seen him different, at any time, although every time was different from the one before!\u201d In other words, you do respond to events, but with a constant appropriateness. You are not fixated on being seen in some specific way; you do not become a sphinx, expecting people to say, \u201cNow he is a realised person.\u201d You are constantly, at all times, instantly encompassing the zone of the limited while having access to, and reflecting, the limitless. The two combined! What role does leadership play? Well, you are always misled, unless you are led by what we are talking about. Everything else is just different layers of being misled. It is too short-lived to only be concerned about this moment\u2019s pleasure of what goes in my mouth, or what I see right now. I want a more durable comfort zone, or period of happiness. This desire for more durability means you are only led by that which never misleads you. That is, essentially, God and His agent in you, which is your soul. His messenger in you. We also know the profile of the great messengers and their models. If you live as though you are surrounded by them, then you have constant referencing. What would the Prophet have done, had he been here? Ask him! You will eventually begin to have the answer from within you\u2026 What would be the prescription for a higher order in society today? It is for most members of the society to want the highest; the permanent; the eternal; the zone of no conflict, which emanates from themselves. So, it would be a self-governing society, with the best amongst us used - collectively - as reference points. Does Islam have a role to play? What are its challenges? Well, Islam is the optimum code of conduct to live by, if people absorb and live it. Otherwise it becomes yet another entity talked and argued about, but not lived. That is why Islam is forever applicable and usable, but Muslims function only according to their ability to absorb it, live by it and be transformed by it. So, of course, it is the most easy way to adopt and follow and live by. The challenges altogether are the same as for every individual and every society, in that we all want to have access to a zone that allows us to journey through this world, exhibiting safe conduct, leading to a safe arrival which also transcends the limitations of this world, so that we are ready for the Garden. The entire business is motivated by love of the eternal Garden and its permanent perfections. We are practicing it here in this world, so that - by the time of departure, when the soul leaves the body - you are already soaring in a zone that you are prepared for, not something strange or unknown. Inwardly, you are already experiencing the Garden. Then you are, in every way, taken away from its shadows of this world. What is the role of saints, sages, and monks in society\u2019s life? Again, it\u2019s like role models. We love people who have been emancipated, who have been freed from what we normally are imprisoned, overwhelmed or depressed by. So, I love the person who is more knowledgeable than I; who is more emancipated, more free than I; more contained, more steady, more reliable, more trustworthy than I. They are, again, different frequencies manifesting as human beings, which leads me to the original, divine frequency of yielding unconditionally, of loving passionately, listening without hearing, just knowing that it is the True Voice. What is the illness of the world today and what can we do to avoid falling into the same trap? Illnesses and cures don\u2019t change. The illness is deflection and deviation, and the cure is knowledge, acknowledgement, and contentment. What has happened now in this world is that individuals have been so separated from the usual collective mirroring of a family or a community or a society, that I think that the ills of today can become - in fact - a tremendous impetus towards the remedy of tomorrow. This is because individuals must become responsible. You have no uncle or aunt or village people to run after you and reprimand you. You have to reprimand yourself so that you maintain a clearer and much more immediate reference to the higher in you. You have to become responsible for yourself, by yourself. You know that, if you have deviated from that upward vision, you are punishing yourself by your misdeeds, not because of them. God does not punish you and I. We punish ourselves by our stupidity, by not constantly referring to the highest in us. Society, which is fragmented right now, can equally rise more quickly if the individuals within it take that spiritual responsibility upon themselves. If the prescription is personal responsibility, what is the role of culture and civilization? It is both: there has to be self-reliance and there has to be reflectiveness from others in society. Then this mirroring can reach a crescendo. There have been occasions in human history where there have been very, very high spiritual effulgences, and the reverse. There is this self-enhancing situation of frenzy, which can be positive or negative. If there are enough people in society who are more and more tuned to the higher in them, then naturally that society will flourish in a highly spiritual way, and vice versa. It is related. I contain a universe, and the universe outside me is - in a way - a reflector of me. I naturally end up where that outer universe enhances my universe. That\u2019s why we are in different places with different people, doing different activities. The like seeks the like. Spiritual people end up being closer together, artists closer together, thieves closer together and so on. You end up wanting to reflect and constantly reinforce the state of consciousness that you are in. If you are attaining higher and higher inner bliss, then you are more and more independent of others, more and more self-reliant, and you have less and less self-image or self-concern, because now you have a soul concern. It is a displacement. People who come to you, or whom you meet are then of a similar tendency. It is a natural movement, which seeks its own confirmation. We want to be confirmed, all the time. Is there hope? Constantly! More and more. The more there is distortion, the more there can be assertion of the truth. The more there are lies, the more they actually indicate the other side - the light of which they are the shadow. They go together. Difficult times can be an opportunity to usher in easy times. But ease can only last if it is the ease of the higher, not the ease of comfort and luxury, because there is no end to that.","title":"The Soul"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk3/#what-should-we-be-guided-by","text":"To start with, the world is not made of opposites. It manifests as opposites. Its essence is One, its attributes all relate to the One, and its physical manifestations are all - in every way - permeated and are living, moving, and changing by the One. So, we seek to be guided by that which is forever reliable. In other words, it is the nature of this reality that it manifests in time and space, but its energising force - its creative governing principle - is from beyond time and space. We need to constantly refer to that zone which is steady, constant, ever-reliable and ever-secure. In other words, God-within-us or the soul. We need to refer to that constantly in order to make sense out of ever-changing situations, all of which draw our attention to our need to choose appropriately so that we always end up in a state of equilibrium and homeostasis. We each need to have some reference point. That is the guidance we seek. We want guidance which is not subject to change, which is not subject to the relative ups and downs. I am subjected constantly, minute-to-minute in each of my senses, to things which change and yet I want to steer a course which gives me that inner constancy so that, in my heart, I am content and happy. Therefore, I need that reference to a zone which is forever reliable, which is what I call the soul. And my access to the soul is through my heart, because the soul dwells in my heart. If the heart is pure, then I have access to it.

As a baby, I develop the first layer by seeing the mother, or seeing movement and motion. In time, it becomes more like a bank or vault which contains pictures, and then the meanings of pictures. Thus, when I see something I liked, it immediately triggers off a desire to attain it again. Or, the reverse: I have in my mind something which was disagreeable, which immediately triggers in my mind the meaning of disagreeability . My mind is constantly used in order to steer an existential balance, with reference to that constant point within, but it is - in itself - tricky! Ultimately, my mind is the imprisonment of my higher consciousness. It is the veil of that higher consciousness. I must have a good mind, but then transcend it. I must have a pure heart, and refer to the higher element which is within it. I do not deny the mind, but I must not be constantly subjected to the mind. The intellect also reflects the higher. It reflects the soul. Therefore, it is more rational. It is not subject to my personal emotions. I can refer to you with my intellect, not through my emotions. I have had a different upbringing, different exposures and experiences - as have you - but where we can meet is through intellect, reasoning and - higher than that - through our hearts; which is unconditional love.

So, I was about to trust my soul, I was about to reach\u2026 but I got deflected by trusting the other fellow too long, or too much without letting that stepping stone (of trusting a person) lead me to the trusting zone within me.

I can say, \u201cMy trait has been this\u201d or \u201cI have short feet,\u201d but it is of no real consequence. I may have been brought up with great difficulty in the ghettos, but it is of no consequence!

We are all the time trying to bring forth that which we think - at that moment - is good for us and avoid that which we think - at that moment - is bad for us. If you measure the good and the bad in terms of longevity or durability, then you are nearer to the reference of truth and guidance within you. In other words, what is ultimately good for me is to have access to a zone that constantly thrills me and gives me personal contentment and happiness. That is really what is good, without a bad. Every other good can be bad. What is good for me now can be bad for me tomorrow. What is good for a kid can be ridiculous for an adult, and vice versa. Good and bad are relative in themselves. There is no such thing as permanent good or permanent bad, except One Absolute Good. That is the knowledge of the Light which permeates all other lights and all other shadows. That is Absolute Good.

We are programmed to go back to the foundation where equanimity, balance, and wellness can take place at all of these different levels. If I know that it is physical and material, then it is easier for me to remedy and it is easier for others to help me. If I know it is mental, then it is a bit more difficult. Once it is mental and I am not willing to confess it or reveal and am simply accusing others and blaming others, then it is even more difficult. The entire business is about wanting to know where I am on this atlas, so that I constantly have access to the \u201ccity\u201d: the inner core, or Divine essence. It is like being in a little boat in the ocean: you need to care for the immediate vicinity, but if you don\u2019t constantly also look to the horizon - that is, ask \u201cwhat is the ultimate destiny of all this?\u201d - there is no point in just caring for the boat and your body. You equally need to look constantly at the target horizon for which you are aiming. Now, the situation with this map or atlas is that there are keys to it. What is the foundation for my constant anxiety, insecurity or depression, and how can I regain a certain modicum of my ability to advance hope? It is not a question of this onerous thing: it is already there! I just have to be able to access it. Those patterns are in us, like an old film where you first had to produce the negative, and from it comes the positive. I have to know the negative, and then the positive will emerge. It is part and parcel of growth and development that I seek to know which aspect of me is now upsetting me, or bothering me, or misleading me. Until I realise that all of them are me! The lowest is in me and the highest is in me. If I pay attention to the lowest, then I will not be focussed on the higher and my priorities are wrong. As a six or seven-year-old child whose intellect is not fully developed, you are expected to be selfish and brutish and demanding and so on. But when that persists to the age of forty, something is drastically wrong. What gives form to this map? What role does the environment play in your specific reading of the road signs? The road signs are based on fundamentals. Amongst these fundamentals are what appears to be the opposites, which in reality are complementary. I have an inner aspect to me - which contains the subtle mind and the heart - and I have an outer aspect. The same thing applies to a society: its conduct, behaviour, and culture has got an inner meaning and an outer manifestation. Inner - outer. Meaning - form. Subtle, unseen, heavenly - and earthly. All of these are part of it. Now, when I pray and I don\u2019t move, it is subtle and has an inner, heavenly meaning. When I am running from a lion, it is earthly, outward form. The whole thing is interconnected and interrelated! This map is multidimensional: it\u2019s about existence . It\u2019s not just about my mind or my feelings. My feelings are a result of my overall makeup. They reflect the outer world and therefore I am dissatisfied, because I see in it a lot of discord and disharmony. Yet, the inner and the outer meet, and we want that meeting point to be - all the time - understandable and in balance. We are seekers of balance, equanimity and peace; all of which are - again - attributes of the Divine light in us. God is forever at peace: He is never agitated. I am agitated in order to yield to that yearning and the desire for that peace. Do we need a map reading course to understand and apply this? Well, if you have been on a rough road - as I have been many times in my life, with a lot of bumps and a bad car - you would. We are all - in every instant in our life - wanting and needing to know and to be inwardly certain and secure. So we do need such a course. These multilayered maps are there, but we have to want to read them and then, with that wanting, we will come to know them; we will come to read them more fully. Occasionally, we need cartographers and so on: a spiritual teacher; someone to look up to; a role model. That will continue and you may, as you grow, change the reflection of which you are most in need. Do we become the people who design this roadmap for ourselves? No, the roadmap is existence : it depends where you are in it. In truth, it\u2019s where you are that determines _who _you are. If you are on a clear highway, with all the right signs, then you are in a manner of equanimity and wisdom and you are a sage. If you are all the time confused and complaining and swearing - as everyone is these days on the roads - then you, like anyone else, neither know the map, nor the driver, nor the condition of the road, car or environment. You are a mixed up person, as most of us are. However, because we are programmed not wanting to remain mixed up, we seek the answers to \u201cWhere is it?\u201d, \u201cWho am I?\u201d, \u201cWhere am I going?\u201d, \u201cHow will I get there?\u201d and so on, gaining more inner knowledge, confidence and tranquility. \u201cWhy am I not ready for departure from this world?\u201d Because I have no idea about the next world, which is why I am afraid. Fear of death is fear of the unknown, but why is it unknown?! Simply because I have been spending too much time in the frivolous known: the day-to-day hurly-burly, up and down, trying to pay bills and so on. We are not just these rational, mundane creatures. That is an outer manifestation of an inner, permanent reality. It is real that we get depressed. It is real that we lose hope. It is real that we get let down. But these realities are passing. Everyone is looking, all the time, for a zone of reality that never ever changes, which we call - if you like - the Absolute, or Trust, or Truth. It is that to which I can refer. Such a reference allows you to put the fact that you are on a bumpy road in perspective. The ultimate objective of every seeker, every person who wants that inner constancy of joy and contentment, is to be able to refer to a zone that reflects the Truth. Is religious dogma helpful? For those who remain within that dogma, yes. But, once they see beyond it\u2026 [laughs] Religion helps in the sense of providing a certain cohesion in a culture or society, but invariably, most of these effulgences by prophets or messengers end up being too structured and they end up being worshipped, rather than their being a message towards and about the worship-able! Within many of these religions, the people who profess to be religious end up worshipping their religion, rather than divine; the Absolute Creator of it all. How does one reconcile the different religions and teachings without involving oneself in a lifetime of reading and experimentation? If the prophets and messengers were true - if they truly were reflecting the eternal truth in them and above them and before them and after them - then the essence is the same. The way that message came out and was made available to that culture or society differs, according to the times they were in. The prophet Noah lived at a time where there was a lot of human mischief and disruption, and that mischief was causing global disruption - changes in the atmosphere and so on - thus he warned the people that there were going to be catastrophic events. That was a special thing in those days and that time. The same applies to the prophet Jesus, with his ability to heal and produce miracles, all of which were important for the people living at the time he came, with their particular language (Arameic) and culture. In essence, they are all the same. The way they are interpreted later, the structured part, changes. In the case of Islam, you have got the whole package of both the outer and the inner, the essence and the outer practices and boundaries. So, in a way, you are less able to manipulate it because you are supposed to have regular performance of prayers, the idea being that you will be in prayer all the time. There is an inner meaning to all of these rituals. In essence, all true messages are the same. In terms of the practice, timing, relevance and applicability, they change. For example, at the time of Buddha, there were huge spaces and people could move away if they were oppressed or depressed, so there was no need to regulate societal interactions. However, as time developed, there was a need for certain kinds of societal foundations. Take the case of alcohol and its detrimental effects. There was hardly any alcohol a thousand years ago! So it is the appropriateness within a certain measure of the regulatory side which differs. Is there not a danger that one gets stuck in outer religious practices to the detriment of their inner meaning? There is, of course. People get waylaid by the rituals and start worshipping their religion, rather than using the path as a flying carpet to be in the ever-present light and delight of the divine Creator. But this is not the fault of the True Path, or the True Religion, it is the fault of the practitioners, because we want something which is not able to fathom or encompass that which is the Source of every want and every desire and every existence. We can\u2019t take it! We can\u2019t take the vastness of the Divine Presence\u2026 So we become these small-minded things and end up being blocked by our little desires. That is why one needs a teacher; a guide to align you with the ultimate Light. The religion then acts only as a highway code. The prophetic conduct is just a template, a role model. How important is the spiritual teacher or guide for the self-journey? I think it is indispensable. You can\u2019t but want to resonate and tune your frequency to another frequency that is more reliable. That is why you like to be with people who are happy, people who are wealthy, people who are free. Because that enhances your synchronicity with your own inner zone of freedom. You want to enhance your access to those qualities that are already in you. So the outer person, or the teacher, or the prophet, is a mirror towards that which is inner. If they are a truly enlightened person, then that mirror is clearer than any other one. You can\u2019t see the sun, but you like to have a reflector of the sun. You look at the moon and you know the sun is there. You look at the light and you know that the original Light is already there. You want to look at a person who is - at all times - in tune with the higher in them, which means they are not succumbing or faltering or falling into the fear and the miseries of the shadows. We all want that! Are such people identifiable? If one is a sincere seeker, even ordinary people can help along the path. You need to be sensitive to the message, rather than the messenger. If you want to gain wisdom, then you can gain wisdom even from fools. It\u2019s said that \u201cHe is a fool who does not experience anger. But he is wise who does not express it and waste that energy.\u201d We are seekers of wisdom, efficiency, and optimal being at all times. Many people can help us along the path, including looking at the misery of those who are completely off the path. This applies less if you are at a very fine point of self-awakening, though. It\u2019s like mountaineering: if you are near the summit, then self-delusion and illusions and all the other fantasies can become quite dangerous, so you need to have someone who has been there to tell you, \u201cDon\u2019t fall into these inner, subtle, spiritual fantasies.\u201d Spiritual materialism is far worse than non-spirituality. People want to use anything that enhances their love for power, so they become these spiritual characters, which is far worse for everyone. We have this wonderful story of two people walking towards the mosque: one was a very pious person and the other was a well-known rascal. The enlightened being who saw them told his people that this fellow who was a rascal was on his way to the heavens, but the other one is already in hell. They were surprised, because that person had such piety, but the answer was that his piety is the veil preventing him from submitting totally, utterly, to the Divine. The other fellow is wretched, and God loves the wretched and the weak and the meek and the depressed and the needy. It is to do with humility. Spiritual arrogance is the worst type of veil, which brings about hypocrisies and misleads people. Where does Sufism stand? Sufism, basically, is the heart of Islam and it is what preserved - to a great extent - the inner core of enlightenment. Essentially, Islam is the path of acknowledging the outer, keeping to the bounds and boundaries and yet allowing the inner to take you over (which it has already!). You are already possessed by God. You are already taken over. You are already in submission. But now, you have to submit fully to it, with knowledge, so that synchronicity occurs. By choice, you have allowed the Divine Light that is already in you to take you over and pulverize you and recrystallize you. Soon after the departure of the Prophet, the Muslims fell into the usual, structural aspects of culture and society, bearing in mind the power vacuum that was in the world. They soon ended up under the rulership of kings and sultans, many of whom were not spiritual. So, if you like, the model of the philosopher-king ruling soon became modified. It became secular leaders ruling with a religious whip, or having religious people under them. To a great extent, the path of Islam ended up being one from which Muslims deviated, avoiding the original, full accountability so critical to unifying the outer and the inner, or the laws with the spirit and essential foundation of their purpose. Sufis emerged two or three hundred years after the departure of the Prophet, trying to rectify this, because they saw rulers who were very unfit to rule. They didn\u2019t want to fight and create a lot of discord in the community, so they created these lines - if you like - of Sufi paths, to maintain the original, prophetic way. This way is to do your best in this world, for you are accountable here, yet also yield to the Maker of this world, so that you live in thrill, rather than just in Islamic ceremonies. It was basically a movement to rectify a certain diversion that had occurred. So sufism is not a sect? No. Any enlivened Muslim will have realised and seen that these were corrective movements in societies and cultures that had witnessed an aberration. An enlightened Muslim will not be this nor that: they are prophetic followers. They will not have yet another sect, yet another madhab . They have all emerged from one source: the prophetic beingness. So, if you go back to that time, you transcend a lot of cultural, habitual and historical differences and deviations. Then you will put up with the others, and you will understand their attempts, rather than accusing everyone of difference, and following the usual pattern of people\u2019s arguments. What is the root of the human need to trust? It is, again, the original Divine Love, which is beckoning you. The Divine Light has complete and utter self-containment: It does not need anything exogenous to It. It is the Permanent, Absolute, Self-Contained, Self-Loving, Self-Knowing Essence. We have, within us, a reflection of it, a spark of it, which is the soul or the spirit. It is beckoning us! We all need to trust, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have a compass to drive by. I need to trust that this car will get me to the place, or that when I am promised something I will be given it. We need to know that we can meet these divergences in time, so we trust the clock, we trust the government and so on. We want to trust, so that we are constantly looking at the ultimate altar of equanimity, bliss, ease, and beingness. Trust drives us, and we can drive by it! But we need to be tuned to It. Otherwise people can just say, \u201cI trust my heart,\u201d but we don\u2019t know if it is their whims or their emotions or their fear. If it is to do with your soul, it can never lie, because it is always consistent. Is there a difference between trust and faith? I would define faith as a broader avenue that may lead to the ultimate, specific trust. We all have faith that I will come, one day, to trust. That\u2019s why we need to have access to people who are trustworthy, which is also why it is very difficult nowadays to trust. Even the language points at this with \u201cantitrust\u201d laws and so on. If you have trusted people and they have let you down, how do you remedy that? With difficulty [laughs]. If a person is really healthy, they will realise that they have misplaced trust. If trusting others leads you to trusting yourself more - the higher in you - then it is the right direction. Ultimately, you want to trust that frequency which is the attribute of Trust (an attribute of the Divine) which is within both me and you. That is why, if you truly trust in the higher, even untrustworthy persons end up being trustworthy to you! It is amazing: you regenerate trust in them. As you sow, so you reap. So the intelligent, wise parent turns the trust of the child from themselves towards the higher. Thus, when the child realises that the parents are also human beings liable to faults, they do not blame them and begin to distrust everyone in sight. We are - all of us, in a way - transmitting the ultimate and the penultimate and the shadow, so we have to realise that these are the multiple layers of consciousness that we are all subjected to.","title":"The Map"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk4/#is-an-extremely-detailed-map-really-necessary","text":"It is not a question of necessity: it is unavoidable . You are on this journey: you need to know the lay of the land and the condition of the car, the fuel, the environment, the atmosphere, the signs etc. It\u2019s not a question of necessary, onerous, simple or difficult. It is unavoidable. The moment you are created, you are on a path wanting to know the direction, meaning and purpose behind Creation. We have, within our makeup, many layers and varieties of consciousness, which are programmed to unfold over the full range of genetic, chemical, mechanical, electrical and every other aspect of the entire human. For you and I to know why what is happening is happening, we need to have access to the foundation, so that we can read. Otherwise, when I am disturbed - or emotionally upset and have no idea about what the cause was and why it occurred - I will muddle through a life that becomes increasingly complex and vague. We want to know! We are never content with ignorance, shadow or darkness. At the physical level, we want to know what is wrong with the body.

To a great extent, the path of Islam ended up being one from which Muslims deviated, avoiding the original, full accountability so critical to unifying the outer and the inner, or the laws with the spirit and essential foundation of their purpose. Sufis emerged two or three hundred years after the departure of the Prophet, trying to rectify this, because they saw rulers who were very unfit to rule. They didn\u2019t want to fight and create a lot of discord in the community, so they created these lines - if you like - of Sufi paths, to maintain the original, prophetic way. This way is to do your best in this world, for you are accountable here, yet also yield to the Maker of this world, so that you live in thrill, rather than just in Islamic ceremonies. It was basically a movement to rectify a certain diversion that had occurred.","title":"Where does Sufism stand?"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk4/#so-sufism-is-not-a-sect","text":"No. Any enlivened Muslim will have realised and seen that these were corrective movements in societies and cultures that had witnessed an aberration.

Then you will put up with the others, and you will understand their attempts, rather than accusing everyone of difference, and following the usual pattern of people\u2019s arguments.","title":"So sufism is not a sect?"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk4/#what-is-the-root-of-the-human-need-to-trust","text":"It is, again, the original Divine Love, which is beckoning you.

We have, within us, a reflection of it, a spark of it, which is the soul or the spirit. It is beckoning us! We all need to trust, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have a compass to drive by. I need to trust that this car will get me to the place, or that when I am promised something I will be given it. We need to know that we can meet these divergences in time, so we trust the clock, we trust the government and so on. We want to trust, so that we are constantly looking at the ultimate altar of equanimity, bliss, ease, and beingness. Trust drives us, and we can drive by it! But we need to be tuned to It. Otherwise people can just say, \u201cI trust my heart,\u201d but we don\u2019t know if it is their whims or their emotions or their fear. If it is to do with your soul, it can never lie, because it is always consistent.","title":"What is the root of the human need to trust?"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk4/#is-there-a-difference-between-trust-and-faith","text":"I would define faith as a broader avenue that may lead to the ultimate, specific trust.

If a person is really healthy, they will realise that they have misplaced trust. If trusting others leads you to trusting yourself more - the higher in you - then it is the right direction. Ultimately, you want to trust that frequency which is the attribute of Trust (an attribute of the Divine) which is within both me and you. That is why, if you truly trust in the higher, even untrustworthy persons end up being trustworthy to you! It is amazing: you regenerate trust in them. As you sow, so you reap. So the intelligent, wise parent turns the trust of the child from themselves towards the higher. Thus, when the child realises that the parents are also human beings liable to faults, they do not blame them and begin to distrust everyone in sight. We are - all of us, in a way - transmitting the ultimate and the penultimate and the shadow, so we have to realise that these are the multiple layers of consciousness that we are all subjected to.","title":"If you have trusted people and they have let you down, how do you remedy that?"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk5/","text":"\u201cDiscovering the light within us is the ultimate quest. This means connecting the seen and the unseen; the boundless and the bounded and the rewards are the ability to refer to the inner zone of perfection, contentment and bliss.\u201d How do we conduct ourselves to ensure we stay on this path? By stopping misconducting ourselves. In truth, there is only the Light, before us, after us, within us. By \u2018truth\u2019 I mean, if there is anything that is constant and forever, it is that Light, which manifests in these infinite varieties of shadows, consciousnesses, memories, desires and so on. We are - in every way - led by this Light and misled by its shadows. Mercy and the eternal love emanates from that. It is only denial and hate which emanates from us when we look at the shadows. As we discussed earlier, every movement in this existence is based on Divine Love, and emanates from it, though it may manifest in different forms. As a child, I want to attract what I consider desirable and repel what I consider undesirable, so I become greedy. I become angry. I display all of the lower tendencies and emotions. But, once I begin to groom myself, then my desire and greed for attraction becomes modesty. I can say, \u201cIt\u2019s enough now\u201d. You have enough; get on with the real project, which is to reconnect consciously with the Light which is connected to you anyway, though you may not yet know it. Modesty emanates from grooming the tendency of attraction. Courage is the groomed tendency of anger, of repulsion, of chasing and accusing others. From that courage emanates all the other virtues of tolerance, putting up with the others, manliness, forgiveness and so on. When you have courage and modesty, you begin to open up - inadvertently - the doors of wisdom. You become a wise person, which simply means that you do the right thing, at the right time, in the right way. You are not a fool, who may have a good intention, but is seeding the field in midwinter or at a time when there is no rain. As you gain wisdom, the intellect grows. With that comes retention and higher, subtler intelligence, along with openings into the unseen in terms of creativity, which requires a subtler intellect not only based on reason and rationality. If these elements of the lower self are groomed as we mature, then justice becomes manifest in the person. One of the main successes of the West - in fact - is that sense of justice, or fair play. Fair play implies that, even though you may have the upper hand, you do not apply it fully. Give the other people a chance; be tolerant. Justice is that the Absolute source of justice allows us to misjudge, cause injustice and yet we are still acceptable. It seems like most of us want to stay children? Absolutely, and they do. The society and its entertainment and film industry, and your \u201cfriendly\u201d bank will help you do so. That\u2019s why there is very little spiritual content in the societal sense. There are many more individuals who are beginning to awaken and desire gnosis or enlightenment, but in society at large, the mainstream has taken on the dimension of an avalanche. How do you know if you\u2019re doing the right thing? You have no doubt any more! In that, you are constantly aware of the zone of doubts, but you know that it is the only thing you could do, nothing else. You have no regrets. You don\u2019t go back and forth in your memory. There is nothing else you could have done. This is, in fact, one of the meanings of the infallibility of prophets or messengers: they could not have done differently in their circumstances. But, if you look at historically, and analyze it in your own way, then you may say, \u201cHe was at fault.\u201d But, if you were him, in those circumstances - and enlightened - you could not have done differently. That requires a high level of intellect and wisdom. But, for the person transforming from child to adult, how do you know? It\u2019s difficult: I try to avoid them [laughs]. There is a lot of hit and miss and a lot of mistakes, which is why we say, \u201cGod is All-Forgiving.\u201d In reality, your soul forgives you. You have many, many chances, provided you constantly go back to the zone of your ultimate objective. Then it is all washed off and all is alright. There is nothing wrong with making mistakes, provided your radar is locked onto that objective. But, if it is all haphazard - as in most cases: \u201cWhy not? We\u2019ll go here!\u201d or \u201cWhy not this?\u201d, \u201cWhy not that?\u201d - then it never ends. It is all a diversion which leads to destruction, under the name of entertainment. It is killing time; it is killing yourself, rather than giving you more light. What techniques can we employ? Are prayer and meditation important? Definitely. In fact, we are constantly given opportunities to reflect through difficulties, failures, grief, and depression so that we turn to the other side of it and see the meaning. Prayer is an immense platform for basic humility. The less self-image and self-concern you have, the more you have light-concern and inner awakening. But, the more you have identified with this role, the more you become only that role, so you have locked yourself into that limitation and there is no oxygen in you for the limitless to emit its light. Therefore, the lower self becomes so separate from the soul that there is a breakdown. The breakdown of any system, like a nervous breakdown - or even suicide - is an aspect of that. You have identified so deeply with the roles and the lower side that the higher side is almost disconnected: there is no longer any recharge. Prayer - if you plug in - recharges your self, reconnects it to your soul and your heart becomes clear. These are all techniques of unifying humpty-dumpty [laughs]. Really, we are all like that. An aspect is ridiculous, but the origin is sublime. Once you have connected them, then you have the two oceans in you: the eternal and the ever-changing. This can seem like a trade-off of a life of pleasure and happiness for one of abandonment and deprivation? Trade-off is the right word, but not towards deprivation. It is about transcending pleasure into joy. Transcending limited, short-lived excitements into overflowing bliss. It is a trade-off and we are programmed to move from the transient to the eternal; from the frivolous to the perfect and ever-lasting. If you remain only with pleasure, then it never ends: you are always just moving from one facet to another and you think it is different, but it is short-lived and you know . Every person knows whether they are content or not. Ask people to what extent are they truly content, not content because of some thing. You see, if you are content because of some thing, then you will be discontent when that thing is removed. Or, that which gives you pleasure now may give you displeasure later. I can\u2019t trust that! I want to have access to a constant situation which is forever available; from me, by me, through the mercy of the One who made me and made all of these different creations. You become godly, in a sense; you do not become God with the implied spiritual pomposity. You become simply, consciously illumined. You were already illumined before without knowing it. Now you know it. And you know its shadow, and you live by the two, through the courtesy of the One. How can turning away from self-interest lead us to abundance and prosperity? It will work well if you move on from the lower trend of seeking profit and power, to the knowledge of the All-Powerful. We are all seekers of wealth - boundless wealth! - and if you stop and reflect on the limitations of the outer possibilities, then that can lead you to the inner meaning of the zone of wealth. Profit and power are initial steps - there is nothing wrong with them - but you will never be satisfied by outer wealth, because you will never be able to decide on what is enough. We are all seekers of infinite power, infinite wealth, infinite bliss; reliable beyond any possibility of change. We are all seeking the perfections of the soul in a zone which is like a kindergarten, which leads us out after we realise that, in this zone, you cannot attain absolute wealth, power or mercy. Yet you know there is an Absolute zone, because we can compare it. Why is the Absolute not intuitively and instinctively part of everything we do? It is. By instinct, you know that you are not happy. By instinct, you know that this is not enough, that you are not totally content, that you are not ready to leave this world. If you are not ready to leave this world, then you are not qualified to take it, because it will take you. The two go together. If you are ready to abandon it, then you have access to the abundance of it. Then it doesn\u2019t matter - longer life, shorter life - because you know that Life is forever. This phase of it can be long or short. It doesn\u2019t matter. Death will not frighten you. If It is present in every human being, can this be done by anyone, or everyone? Sure. Otherwise where is God\u2019s mercy? The potential is for everyone, all the time. The condition is to turn away from that which is not. That which is, is. It is wrong for us to think that we are getting closer to God. You can\u2019t be closer to what is closeness itself. You can only go further away from the shadows which are distant reflections of God. Turn away from that which is not; that which has always been is. It is selection, a trade-off. Why has the path of enlightenment often been referred to as mysterious and mystical? I think this word is often used by people who are often ignorant, or who want to maintain a certain elitist position. They frame it as a mysterious, mystical, secret thing - an exclusive club to which you have to be admitted. My answer to that is, \u201cWhere is God\u2019s generosity to everyone, at all times?\u201d The truth is that it takes energy and determination and passion, though most people remain in the zone of the lower familiarities; the basic animal tendencies of just eating, shopping, blaming, accumulating, stealing, and lying. They don\u2019t have enough love for the higher in them because they haven\u2019t tasted it. There is no mystery in knowledge. It\u2019s just that it is currently unknown. As for the question of logic and reason: you can take logic to its final end and, after that, it is supra-logic: another zone which is beyond reasoning, beyond the mind, beyond the limitations of the intellect. It is the zone of lights and delights, to which our experiences in this world are the equivalent of the tip of an iceberg. There is so much in the unseen and the unknown. This world of ours is a tiny, little reflection of different aspects of the unseen. Once that taste is developed, then you are hooked by it, from yourself. People call it \u201cthe divine calling\u201d or vocation, though all of it is to do with the natural tendency that was always there but had not been allowed, or given the opportunity, to grow. It\u2019s like a seed: it has the potential to fruit, but if you put the seed on a rock for ten years, nothing will happen. The potential is there, but you must give it the water of love for knowledge and delight in the openings of new horizons of consciousness so it will grow. The fruit of it is self-knowledge: that you will know, by yourself, at the time you need to know. Just turn away from ignorance, and don\u2019t allow the shadows to depress you. In summary, what can one do practically to implement all these ideas? You can constantly shift your desires and identifications towards the higher, towards the abstract, towards the subtle and the durable. There is nothing wrong with you taking any worldly pleasure, but then move that into another zone where it can be more durable and long-lasting. Consider any good relationship - if you desire to maintain it for a longer period in a higher domain - then you are getting towards the source, which is in you and him and her; it is where we all unify. It is where union is . My advice is constantly to move from the gross towards the subtle, because that is more durable. Once an energy has manifested, it is a specific manifestation, whether it is a fridge or a fan. However, maintain the electric power itself, and you\u2019ll see it contains all the possibilities. The fridge and the fan meet where the power is, before it has manifested. My advice - to myself and everyone else - is to look at the source behind the attributes, and look at the attributes behind the actions and manifestations. You will find the unifying factor, called the Divine Cosmos. Wherever you look is the manifestation of the Divine. Whatever has come is by He Who has made it come and to Him it returns. The other easy formula is \u201cbe willing to abandon and let go\u201d. We are hanging on air, so why not remember that the breath which goes in may not come out? Then every minute becomes fresh. It is not morbidity. That fear becomes an incentive to live the moment fully. If you have lived the moment fully, you have lived eternally. In grooming one\u2019s self, what prescriptions must be followed? Again, it\u2019s part of the map: there are the normal limitations and the limitless that has brought about this world. I, as a person, must accept and adhere to limiting factors, prescriptions, the prophetically-revealed teachings, and - in the case of a Muslim - the Qur\u2019an and the boundaries it prescribes. The more I adhere to the bounded and limited, the more the limitless begins to shine and inspire me. My job and duty is to accept limitations and the short duration of this life with humility and, if I can do so and use it as a platform to view what is shedding light upon this life, then I have access - inadvertently - to the limitless. The prophetic prescriptions of prayers on time, or fasting, or going on pilgrimage are - in every way - designed for me to see the value and meaning behind the ritual. For example, behind the ritual of fasting lies my desire to be self-sustaining and independent of food or other things . Going on pilgrimage is the same: abandoning everything and moving towards this communion or meeting with the Divine Who is present everywhere, though in this case there is also a specific time, a specific place and all other believers in the Islamic faith present. These practices are thus limited in the outer sense, but they open up vistas far, far greater internally and thus give us satisfaction. The satisfaction comes from admitting my limitation! I forget, therefore I have to be reminded to go down and accept and obey. Then I will find more and more the meaning when transcending the limitations of it. It is necessary for any practitioner to adhere to a system: you can\u2019t say that anything goes and everything is alright and all is free. It\u2019s not. Eventually, people end up chasing their own mental image of freedom, which is the very thing that is imprisoning them! In this realm or dimension of existence we are talking about, there is no Absolute freedom. The soul is already caught in the realm of the world and this world - my world, my image, my ego - must yield to it. As it yields to it, the world almost becomes insignificant and I can begin to feel the freedom and limitlessness of the soul and the One who made it. The less there is of \u201cme\u201d, the more there is of the light which is illuminating me. Therefore, these practices of limitation and adherence, constant night vigils, meditation in various forms are all important to transcend the limitations that \u201cI\u201d am used to.","title":"Conducting the Ultimate Quest"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk5/#how-do-we-conduct-ourselves-to-ensure-we-stay-on-this-path","text":"By stopping misconducting ourselves.

Just turn away from ignorance, and don\u2019t allow the shadows to depress you.","title":"Why has the path of enlightenment often been referred to as mysterious and mystical?"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk5/#in-summary-what-can-one-do-practically-to-implement-all-these-ideas","text":"You can constantly shift your desires and identifications towards the higher, towards the abstract, towards the subtle and the durable. There is nothing wrong with you taking any worldly pleasure, but then move that into another zone where it can be more durable and long-lasting. Consider any good relationship - if you desire to maintain it for a longer period in a higher domain - then you are getting towards the source, which is in you and him and her; it is where we all unify. It is where union is . My advice is constantly to move from the gross towards the subtle, because that is more durable. Once an energy has manifested, it is a specific manifestation, whether it is a fridge or a fan. However, maintain the electric power itself, and you\u2019ll see it contains all the possibilities. The fridge and the fan meet where the power is, before it has manifested. My advice - to myself and everyone else - is to look at the source behind the attributes, and look at the attributes behind the actions and manifestations. You will find the unifying factor, called the Divine Cosmos. Wherever you look is the manifestation of the Divine. Whatever has come is by He Who has made it come and to Him it returns. The other easy formula is \u201cbe willing to abandon and let go\u201d. We are hanging on air, so why not remember that the breath which goes in may not come out? Then every minute becomes fresh. It is not morbidity. That fear becomes an incentive to live the moment fully. If you have lived the moment fully, you have lived eternally.","title":"In summary, what can one do practically to implement all these ideas?"},{"location":"audios/series/transcripts/sk5/#in-grooming-ones-self-what-prescriptions-must-be-followed","text":"Again, it\u2019s part of the map: there are the normal limitations and the limitless that has brought about this world. I, as a person, must accept and adhere to limiting factors, prescriptions, the prophetically-revealed teachings, and - in the case of a Muslim - the Qur\u2019an and the boundaries it prescribes. The more I adhere to the bounded and limited, the more the limitless begins to shine and inspire me. My job and duty is to accept limitations and the short duration of this life with humility and, if I can do so and use it as a platform to view what is shedding light upon this life, then I have access - inadvertently - to the limitless. The prophetic prescriptions of prayers on time, or fasting, or going on pilgrimage are - in every way - designed for me to see the value and meaning behind the ritual. For example, behind the ritual of fasting lies my desire to be self-sustaining and independent of food or other things . Going on pilgrimage is the same: abandoning everything and moving towards this communion or meeting with the Divine Who is present everywhere, though in this case there is also a specific time, a specific place and all other believers in the Islamic faith present. These practices are thus limited in the outer sense, but they open up vistas far, far greater internally and thus give us satisfaction. The satisfaction comes from admitting my limitation! I forget, therefore I have to be reminded to go down and accept and obey. Then I will find more and more the meaning when transcending the limitations of it. It is necessary for any practitioner to adhere to a system: you can\u2019t say that anything goes and everything is alright and all is free. It\u2019s not. Eventually, people end up chasing their own mental image of freedom, which is the very thing that is imprisoning them! In this realm or dimension of existence we are talking about, there is no Absolute freedom. The soul is already caught in the realm of the world and this world - my world, my image, my ego - must yield to it. As it yields to it, the world almost becomes insignificant and I can begin to feel the freedom and limitlessness of the soul and the One who made it. The less there is of \u201cme\u201d, the more there is of the light which is illuminating me. Therefore, these practices of limitation and adherence, constant night vigils, meditation in various forms are all important to transcend the limitations that \u201cI\u201d am used to.","title":"In grooming one\u2019s self, what prescriptions must be followed?"},{"location":"books/","text":"Books The nature of the mind is to separate and differentiate, whereas - in truth - everything is linked and connected.

It subsequently evolved to highly complex beings, at the pinnacle of which are humans. In our world of duality war has to be balanced by peace and health has to co-exist with illness. We shall fail if we continue the illusion of eradicating illness or poverty. The most powerful drives within us are to explore, discover, know, feel secure, content and happy.

Every birth announces its biographical end, which is death. The issue of death and the disintegration of the body is a major challenge, which the ego-self avoids. The Prophetic model describes the human journey on earth as a prelude and preparation for the hereafter and its boundlessness \u2013 infinite time and space. After its separation from the body and mind the soul journeys on within a zone of consciousness that is beyond all earthly experiences of good, bad, misery, fear, sorrow, regret, pleasure or temporary happiness. Humanity is seamlessly connected with divinity. Anything that is relative draws its energy from the Absolute Truth whose light lies within the soul. Human life on earth is temporary and fragile whereas Life itself is eternal and constant. This truth will be experienced by all when the cycle of personal life ends where it began in the celestial realm. Human consciousness stretches from boundlessness and includes all earthly shadows resulting from the ego self and its limitations. Our incessant quest for freedom and liberation is due to the nature of the soul itself, totally at one with the Absolute Truth which is free from everything else. Most religions and spiritual practices advocate regular periods for devotion to the cosmic Origin and reflection upon how all earthly experiences of dualities and pluralities emerge from and return to the cosmic Oneness. We all seek stability and security whilst recognizing that our worldly experience is based on change and uncertainty. This inherent conflict can never be resolved but will dissolve by transcending all thoughts and discernible consciousness. Any outer restriction enables the inner light of the soul to shine and it reveals that our human side is only a shadow of the spirit within you. When you are awakened to the truth of Absolute Oneness all earthly experiences will be placed in their appropriate perspective as passing experiences of dualities emerging from unity and returning to it. What may be considered by others as catastrophic events will be experienced by the awakened being as a natural part of creation, existence and awakening to the One. The divine justice and generosity is such that every human being will eventually (mostly after death) realise the mastery of the divine soul within the heart. If one is fortunate to realise this gift in this life and know that the real soul mate is your own spirit in your heart and that is your constant reference for a perfect earthly journey. This realization can be accessed via constant meditation, prayers and transcendence of mind. To avoid uncertainties and the trick of the lower ego- self, constant resonance with the soul within is required. To save yourself from yourself live as a soul.

People everywhere are undergoing a shift to an Awakened state of consciousness which is transforming their understanding of themselves and the world. For some, this shift has been abrupt and dramatic. For others, it has been so gradual that they may not have realized it has occurred. Such shifts, or awakenings, are not new: Christ spoke of the Kingdom of Heaven within, Wahdat al-Wujud amongst the Sufis, Buddhists speak of Nirvana, Zen masters of Satori, Hindus of Moksha, but these traditions generally regard these states as rare and difficult to attain. Many people are therefore skeptical of claims of higher states of consciousness. They find it hard to believe that apparently ordinary friends and neighbors might be experiencing something extraordinary. Maybe they expect Enlightenment to look as remarkable on the outside as it is reputed to be on the inside.

Streamed Live Sunday 21 st March 2021 . Preparation The Quran is the constant companion of Muslims in the journey of life. Its verses are the first sounds recited into the ear of the newborn child. It is recited during the marriage ceremony, and its verses are usually the last words that a Muslim hears upon the approach of death. The Quran also deals fully with the nature of human beings. It teaches us who we are, why we were created and placed here on earth, what our goal in life is, what our responsibilities and rights are according to the Divine Law, what we need to know about the immortality of the human soul and its posthumous states, and the consequences of how we live in this world for our state of being after death. Many are aware that the Quran is concerned with religious life as well as matters related to both individual salvation and the social order, but fewer realize that the Quran is also a guide for the inner spiritual life. Paying attention to the inner meaning of the Quran results in the realization that not only does it contain teachings about creating a just social order and leading a virtuous life that results in a return to God after death in a felicitous state; it also provides the means of returning to God here and now while still in this world. The Quran is therefore also a spiritual guide for the attainment of the truth, a guide for the attainment of grace even in this world. Numerous passages throughout the Sacred Text speak about death, Resurrection, Divine Judgment, Paradise, Hell, and by implication Purgatory as well as the final end of a human beings. The Quran expresses these realities in a most powerful, concrete, and at the same time highly symbolic language. The Hereafter is presented in such a manner that it remains a constant reality in the consciousness of Muslims throughout their lives here in this world. Given the importance and finality of this accounting, when asked, \u201cWho is the most intelligent of believers?\u201d the Prophet replied, \u201cThe most frequent in recalling death, and the best prepared for what follows it, they are the most intelligent.\u201d You may find some important books related to this conversation below: Keys to the Quran The Quran and Its Teachings Relevant Ayat 6:122 Is he who was dead then We raised him to life and made for him a light by which he walks among the people, like him whose likeness is that of one in utter darkness whence he cannot come forth? Thus what they did was made fair seeming to the deniers. 43:11 And Who sent down out of heaven water in measure; and We revived thereby a land that was dead; even so you shall be brought forth; 41:39 And among His signs is this, that you see the earth still, but when We send down on it the water, it stirs and swells: most surely He Who gives it life is the Giver of life to the dead; surely He has power over all things. 7:158 Say: O people! surely I am the Messenger of Allah to you all, of Him Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth there is no god but He; He brings to life and causes to die therefore believe in Allah and His messenger, the Ummi Prophet who believes in Allah and His words, and follow him so that you may walk in the right way. 2:28 How do you deny Allah and you were dead and He gave you life? Again He will cause you to die and again bring you to life, then you shall be brought back to Him. 3:185 Every self will taste death, and you will only be given your compensation on the Day of Resurrection. So he who is drawn away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise has attained. And what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion. 20:74 Indeed, whoever comes to his Lord as a criminal - indeed, for him is Hell; he will neither die therein nor live. 18:99 Upon that day We shall leave them surging on one another, and the Trumpet shall be blown, and We shall gather them together. 25:15 Say, Is that better or the Garden of Eternity which is promised to the reverent? It will be for them a reward and destination. 31:28 Your creation and your resurrection will not be but as that of a single soul. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Seeing. 55:26-27 Everyone on it must pass away. And there will remain the Face of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Glory. 2:156 Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: Truly! To Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return. 6:98 It is He Who hath produced you from a single soul: here is a place of dwelling and a place of departure: We detail Our signs for people who understand. 17:13 And every person We have imposed his fate upon his neck, and We will produce for him on the Day of Resurrection a record which he will encounter spread open. 77:8-13 So when the stars are obliterated. And when the heaven is split. And when the mountains are blown away. And when the messengers time has come. For what Day was it postponed? To the Day of Decision. 14:48 On the Day the earth will be replaced by another earth, and the heavens, and all creatures will come out before Allah, the One, the Prevailing. 28:77 Seek, through that which Allah has given you, the home of the Hereafter; and do not forget your share of the world. And do good as Allah has done good to you. And desire not corruption in the land. Indeed, Allah does not like corrupters. 29:64 And this worldly life is not but diversion and amusement. And indeed, the home of the Hereafter - that is the eternal life, if only they knew. 50:19-21 And the intoxication of death will bring the truth; that is what you were trying to avoid. And the Horn will be blown. That is the appointed Day. And every self will come, with it a driver and a witness. 2:25 And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, This is what we were provided with before. And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.","title":"Experiencing Death Confirms Eternal Life"},{"location":"gatherings/past/2021/death-eternal-life/#preparation","text":"The Quran is the constant companion of Muslims in the journey of life.

Thus what they did was made fair seeming to the deniers. 43:11 And Who sent down out of heaven water in measure; and We revived thereby a land that was dead; even so you shall be brought forth; 41:39 And among His signs is this, that you see the earth still, but when We send down on it the water, it stirs and swells: most surely He Who gives it life is the Giver of life to the dead; surely He has power over all things. 7:158 Say: O people! surely I am the Messenger of Allah to you all, of Him Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth there is no god but He; He brings to life and causes to die therefore believe in Allah and His messenger, the Ummi Prophet who believes in Allah and His words, and follow him so that you may walk in the right way. 2:28 How do you deny Allah and you were dead and He gave you life? Again He will cause you to die and again bring you to life, then you shall be brought back to Him. 3:185 Every self will taste death, and you will only be given your compensation on the Day of Resurrection. So he who is drawn away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise has attained. And what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion. 20:74 Indeed, whoever comes to his Lord as a criminal - indeed, for him is Hell; he will neither die therein nor live. 18:99 Upon that day We shall leave them surging on one another, and the Trumpet shall be blown, and We shall gather them together. 25:15 Say, Is that better or the Garden of Eternity which is promised to the reverent? It will be for them a reward and destination. 31:28 Your creation and your resurrection will not be but as that of a single soul. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Seeing. 55:26-27 Everyone on it must pass away. And there will remain the Face of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Glory. 2:156 Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: Truly! To Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return. 6:98 It is He Who hath produced you from a single soul: here is a place of dwelling and a place of departure: We detail Our signs for people who understand. 17:13 And every person We have imposed his fate upon his neck, and We will produce for him on the Day of Resurrection a record which he will encounter spread open. 77:8-13 So when the stars are obliterated. And when the heaven is split. And when the mountains are blown away. And when the messengers time has come. For what Day was it postponed? To the Day of Decision. 14:48 On the Day the earth will be replaced by another earth, and the heavens, and all creatures will come out before Allah, the One, the Prevailing. 28:77 Seek, through that which Allah has given you, the home of the Hereafter; and do not forget your share of the world. And do good as Allah has done good to you. And desire not corruption in the land. Indeed, Allah does not like corrupters. 29:64 And this worldly life is not but diversion and amusement. And indeed, the home of the Hereafter - that is the eternal life, if only they knew. 50:19-21 And the intoxication of death will bring the truth; that is what you were trying to avoid. And the Horn will be blown. That is the appointed Day. And every self will come, with it a driver and a witness. 2:25 And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, This is what we were provided with before. And it is given to them in likeness.

We hope and pray that this has been a month of healing, contemplation, and joy for all. Fasting is deeply rooted in our consciousness and a means of maintaining physical and mental health for cultural and political reasons. Fasting has been a devotional practice in most religious and spiritual movements through the ages. Islam has prescribed the practice of abstinence and fasting as a means of self-purification and worship. The act of restraining the self from fulfilling its desires purifies and enhances awareness physically, mentally, and spiritually and sensitizes human consciousness. The seeker realizes the weakness of the self and is gratified by the discipline, restriction, and prohibitions, for these limitations, are windows to Allah\u2019s limitlessness. Eid ul Fitr in 2021 is a time of reflection, rejoicing, and gratitude. Ramadan 2021 has been a time to renew our commitment to service. Please ensure you give your Fitrah or set it aside which in South Africa is R48 Fidayah R12 per member of your household before you commence your prayer.","title":"Eid ul Fitr"},{"location":"gatherings/past/2021/fasting-1/","text":"Fasting Ramadan in the Noble Quran - Part 1 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0648\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0645 Streamed Live 17 th April 2021 Introduction From the book Fasting in Islam The word for fasting (sawm) and its derivatives are mentioned some thirteen times in the Qur\u2019an. Four of these verses contain the command to fast in the month of Ramadan, five others deal with fasting either as an expiation for some wrong deed or as a compensation for the omission of an obligatory act; another verse praises the act of fasting, while yet another refers to the fast of Mary, the mother of Jesus, during her vow of silence. The abstention from talking to people enjoined upon the Prophet Zachariah is mentioned in the Qur\u2019an without referring to it as fasting: He said: My Lord! Give me a sign. He said; Your sign is that you will not speak to people for three nights though you are in sound health. (19:10) The month of Ramadan is mentioned only once in the Qur\u2019an along with the injunction to fast. The following verse praises the act of fasting: Surely the men who submit and the women who submit, and the believing men and the believing women, and the obeying men and the obeying women, and the truthful men and the truthful women, and the humble men and the humble women, and the alms-giving men and the alms-giving women, and the fasting men and the fasting women, and the men who guard their private parts and the women who guard, and the men who remember Allah much and the women who remember \u2013 Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a mighty reward.

You can find each part below: Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Ramadan Fast Verses 2:183 O you faithful, the fast is ordained upon you, as it was ordained upon those who came before you \u2013 perhaps you will have reverence. 2:184 For days numbered; and if any of you be sick, or if he be on a journey, then a number of other days; and for those who are able to fast, a redemption by feeding a poor man. Yet better it is for him who volunteers good, and that you should fast is better for you, if you but know. 2:185 The month of Ramadan, wherein the Quran was sent down to be a guidance to the people, and as clear signs of the Guidance and the Salvation. So let those of you, who are present at the month, fast it; and if any of you be sick, or if he be on a journey, then a number of other days; God desires ease for you, and desires not hardship for you; and that you fulfil the number, and magnify God that He has guided you, and haply you will be thankful. 2:187 Permitted to you, upon the night of the Fast, is to go in to your wives; -- they are a vestment for you, and you are a vestment for them. God knows that you have been betraying yourselves, and has turned to you and pardoned you. So now lie with them, and seek what God has prescribed for you. And eat and drink, until the white thread shows clearly to you from the black thread at the dawn; then complete the Fast unto the night, and do not lie with them while you cleave to the mosques. Those are God's bounds; keep well within them. So God makes clear His signs to men; haply they will be godfearing. Fast in Other Verses 19:26 Eat therefore, and drink, and be comforted; and if thou shouldst see any mortal, say, \"I have vowed to the All-merciful a fast, and today I will not speak to any human. 2:196 Fulfil the Pilgrimage and the Visitation unto God; but if you are prevented, then such offering as may be feasible. And shave not your heads, till the offering reaches its place of sacrifice. If any of you is sick, or injured in his head, then redemption by fast, or freewill offering, or ritual sacrifice. When you are secure, then whosoever enjoys the Visitation until the Pilgrimage, let his offering be such as may be feasible; or if he finds none, then a fast of three days in the Pilgrimage, and of seven when you return, that is ten completely; that is for him whose family are not present at the Holy Mosque. And fear God, and know that God is terrible in retribution. 4:92 It belongs not to a believer to slay a believer, except it be by error. If any slays a believer by error, then let him set free a believing slave, and bloodwit is to be paid to his family unless they forgo it as a freewill offering. If he belong to a people at enmity with you and is a believer, let the slayer set free a believing slave. If he belong to a people joined with you by a compact, then bloodwit is to be paid to his family and the slayer shall set free a believing slave. But if he finds not the means, let him fast two successive months -- God's turning; God is All-knowing, All-wise. 5:89 God will not take you to task for a slip in your oaths; but He will take you to task for such bonds as you have made by oaths, whereof the expiation is to feed ten poor persons with the average of the food you serve to your families, or to clothe them, or to set free a slave; or if any finds not the means, let him fast for three days.

God has pardoned what is past; but whoever offends again, God will take vengeance on him, God is All-mighty, Vengeful. 58:4 But whosoever finds not the means, then let him fast two successive months, before the two of them touch one another. And if any man is not able to, then let him feed sixty poor persons -- that, that you may believe in God and His Messenger.

That is his or her awakening to their permanent non-time reality, from which they have emerged. We are given the experience of this life, with all its decrees, for us to know them, accept them and become one with them so that we can see our destiny within them, and our destiny beyond them, when time stops at the point of death. The awareness of this metaphysical reality during this blessed month is even more in focus during the Nights of Power. Enlightenment is to know the perfection and reliability of God\u2019s plan; with reflection and wisdom, we realize that human will is a very small factor in contentment and sustained happiness. Spiritual wisdom leads to witnessing the utter perfection of the instant and abandonment to the moment. Then we come to understand the truth that abundance is available at all times to everyone. This is the final awakening to the state of Oneness. We are brought into time in order that we may face the incredible, unfathomable, never-ending non-time. We are predestined to face eternity. This is the intended perfect destiny and anything else is incomplete. Relevant Ayat 97:1-5 Indeed, We sent the Qur'an down during the Night of Decree. And what can make you know what is the Night of Decree? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. The angels and the Spirit descend, by the leave of their Lord, upon every command. Peace it is until the emergence of dawn. Word by word explanation Qadar (decree) and Qada\u2019 (destiny) in Language Taken from the book Decree and Destiny In language qadar (measure, decree) represents both the delineation and execution of the process by which a final end - signified by qada\u2019 (destiny) - is arrived at. The connotation of processing attached to qadar contains within it the possibility of change; whereas, when a destiny ( qada\u2019 ) has come about a point of irreversibility has been reached. The divine meaning of qadar signifies \u2018creational decree\u2019, while the worldly meaning implies \u2018judgment by word or action\u2019. There is a clear differentiation between Divine qudrah (ability, power) and human qudrah , for human ability differs according to the magnitude of the task, the effort and power it needs to be executed, and is subject to time, whereas for the absolute Creator all actions are possible and effortless at all times. The following are some of the dictionary definitions of qadar and qada\u2019 : Qadar : \u2018extent, scope, quantity, scale, rate, measure, number, sum, amount, degree, grade, worth, value, standing, rank, divine decree\u2019. Qadar can also imply \u2018clarifying, distinguishing, ordering, ordaining\u2019. Qada\u2019 : \u2018severing, ending, closing, determination, conclusion, winding up, completion, accomplishment, carrying out, execution, performance, fulfillment, satisfaction, payment, passing, Divine Decree, destiny, fate, judgment\u2019. Decrees are the rules which define life\u2019s experiences on earth. Most of these rules are describable or measurable, especially those dealing with the visible realities. The rules that govern all aspects of physical (visible and experiential) existence combine with those that control the unseen forces to form a network that will result in, for example, the laws of physics. We can describe the phenomenon of light, for instance, as both a waveband and a particle called a photon. The rules somehow emerge from an unknown domain into describable, measurable, physical laws. So the decrees can be seen as a series of multitudinous models by means of which the creation, seen and unseen, is held together. Destiny is the final occurrence that is experienced by the individual through the passage of time when these laws are enacted. It is when a describable event has already passed through time. The concept of destiny is also parallel in Arabic to another term \u2018 ajal \u2019, which signifies \u2018appointed time, date, deadline, instant of death, respite, delay\u2019. If we say a business partnership has an \u2018 ajal \u2019 of five years, it means that at the end of this period it will have reached its full destiny, which is dissolution. The final destiny of every man is his awakening to his permanent non-time reality, from which he has emerged. We are given the experience of this life, with all its decrees, for us to know them, accept them and become one with them so that we can see our destiny within them, and our destiny beyond them, when time stops at the point of death. Through the discipline of meditative practices, time can be experienced as coming to a stop. Whilst we fear death we love and are dependent on deep sleep, which is the nearest experience to death. If we are able to experience the mini-death of inner contemplation, we stand a good chance of realizing that our true reality, the Source of the cause behind existence, is eternal and ever present. It is only the body that dies, while the soul or spirit continues into perpetuity. The human destiny is potentially the highest of known creations \u2013 as was our beginning. We start life with a basic level of existence and are driven to reach the highest levels of consciousness and experiences. Enlightenment is to know the perfection and reliability of God\u2019s plan; with reflection and wisdom we realize that human will is a very small factor in contentment and sustained happiness. Spiritual wisdom leads to witnessing the utter perfection of the instant and abandonment to the moment. Then we come to understand the truth that abundance is available at all times to everyone. This is the final awakening to the state of Oneness. We are brought into time in order that we may face the incredible, unfathomable, never-ending non-time. So we are already predestined to face eternity. This is the intended perfect destiny and anything else is incomplete. Whatever is in this cosmos, whether it is energy or matter, small or large, is subject to the laws that govern it. Wisdom is to recognize the bounds of these laws and their interactions, which are operative at all times. This can happen on a collective as well as a personal level. The Qur\u2019an relates stories of several communities in Arabia, who were destroyed after warnings which they did not heed. Every destiny is known in the non-time dimension but, for us who are in time, the particular and circumstantial outcome is not known. Man\u2019s destiny is known to God, for God is beyond time and space. Man, however, can play a crucial role in that destiny and make changes within the prescribed limitations that have been ordained for him. Man is not in control of destiny or the decree. Our power is limited to specific situations and times. We do not, ourselves, possess either harm or goodness unless God has willed it. We can see potentially what is harmful to us, and what is beneficial in limited ways. The confusion is due to the mental illusion of being separate from the supreme Reality and Its universal governance. No matter how insignificant something may appear to you, it has its place in the \u2018book\u2019 (patterns of the universe), and it cannot escape from the original design. God\u2019s order will prevail; He will attain His decree. There is a measure and order for everything, so man\u2019s transgressions are according to a measure, and are thus containable. Real freedom belongs to pure consciousness without any iota of movement, change or mental activity. It is the domain of the soul or spirit and not body or mind. The final solution comes when a unified state of experience arises. In this state the individual experiences an instantaneous and harmonized connection between all causes and effects, and lives within a unified field of beingness. He is then simultaneously aware of the ripples of the waves and the calm of the ocean below. When he was seeking the knowledge of decree and destiny he was affected by the waves, although he had some knowledge of the infinite ocean below. However, when he awakes to the unified state, he is both in the infinite non-changing ocean and the ever-changing waves at the same time. He acknowledges both and sees they are one. Until the individual attains this state of union, the correct courtesy is to approach whatever situation in which he finds himself in a state of awareness and to surrender fully to the flow of events. Similarly, for the person who is exploring the shores of an ocean, the correct courtesy is for him to connect fully with the bounds of the ocean and its surface, until such time as the wave beckons him in. Then he will swim, explore and internalize more knowledge. For everything there is a time; a time to remain on the shore and a time to walk in the ocean. The real courtesy is to know the state one is in at each specific moment and be fully at one with that state. This is where head and heart are in unison. Modes of Destiny The first mode is knowledge : ...and surely he was possessed of knowledge because We had given him knowledge, but most people do not know (12:68) . The destiny of the Prophet Ya`qub (Jacob), to whom the verse refers, was to come to know the earthly reasons as well as Allah\u2019s will. The second is announcement , to make something commonly known to a people: And We had declared (made known) unto the Children of Israel in the Book... (17:4) . The third is that of judgment and justice at its different levels: And Allah judges with the truth... (40:20) . The fourth mode is saying , as described in: And We revealed to him this decree... (15:66) . The fifth deals with finishing, terminating : But when We decreed death for him... (34:14) . The sixth is that of order or command : And your Lord has commanded that you shall not serve (any) but Him... (17:23) . The seventh relates to creation : So He ordained them seven heavens in two periods, and revealed in every heaven its affair; and We adorned the lower heaven with brilliant stars and (made it) to guard; that is the decree of the Mighty, the Knowing (41:12) . Initially creation takes place in biological time, then the souls experience infinite time after death. The last of the seven layers of heavens is the physical heaven that we on earth witness above us. Both heavens and earth were created in two periods or two modes. One of these is the visible experiential state, the other the unseen. The eighth is action : ...therefore decide what you are going to decide (act)... (20:72) . This means to exercise judgment and act sincerely. The ninth mode is that of completion : So when Musa had fulfilled the term, and he journeyed with his family... (28:29) . In this context it means to bring a matter to a conclusion and end. The tenth is the close of an affair. This is in reference to destiny with finality: ...the matter is decreed concerning which you enquired (12:41) . When it is said that affairs are all by the judgment of God, or by God\u2019s knowledge, it means that the matter is decreed concerning us who will experience it. God knows the situation and acts according to His perfect justice. The Prophet (pbuh) says: \u2018Truly Allah has created mankind and He knew in which direction they were heading; He bade them and forbade them. Whatever He ordered them to do, He had made it possible for them to fulfill it. Whatever He had forbidden them to do, He had made it possible for them to abstain from.\u2019 \u2018He knew and He wished; He willed and He measured; He decreed and He judged and began it. Then He made come forth what He had decreed. He judged right as what He had measured and measured (decreed) what He willed. So by His knowledge was His wish and by His wish was the will, and by His will was the measure and by His measure were the destinies (His judgments), and by His destinies was the finality. So knowledge was first, and His desire was second, and His will was third. The measure is upon destiny in order to finalize or seal it.\u2019 Imam `Ali ibn Abi Talib (pbuh) said: \u2018For certainly decree is a secret of the secret of Allah, and a veil of Allah\u2019s veil, a preserved sanctuary of Allah lifted up in the veil of Allah, folded up from the creation of Allah, sealed by the seal of Allah earlier on in the knowledge of Allah. \u2018Allah has unburdened His slaves from its knowledge [the entire knowledge of the decree] and lifted it up beyond their witnessing and the extent of their comprehension, because they will not reach it by the knowledge of lordship, nor by the capability of everlastingness, nor by the might of illumination, nor by the power of unification, because it is a pure and abounding sea that is Allah\u2019s. Its depth is what is between the heavens and the earth; its breadth engulfs what is between the east and the west. Black like the darkest night, full of serpents and reptiles, it rises sometimes and subsides at others. At the bottom of it there is a shining sun which no one is allowed to be exposed to except the One Solitary God, the One and Only. For he who dwells upon it and looks at it opposes Allah in His wisdom and competes with Him in His power. Lifting up His veil and revealing Allah\u2019s secrets brings forth the anger of Allah and (whoever does this) his abode will be hell and the worst of outcomes.\u2019 Further Ayat 20:50 He said, 'Our Lord is He who gave everything its form, then guides' 22:74 They measure not Allah with His true measure; surely Allah is All-strong, All-mighty. 54:12 and made the earth to gush with fountains, and the waters met for a matter decreed. 3:154 ...they entertained about Allah thoughts of ignorance quite unjustly, saying: We have no hand in the affair. Say: Surely the affair is wholly (in the hands) of Allah... 65:3 And give him sustenance from whence he thinks not. And whoever trusts in Allah, He is sufficient for him. Surely Allah attains His purpose. Allah indeed has appointed a measure for everything. 13:31 And even if there were a Qur\u2019an with which the mountains were made to pass away, or the earth were travelled over with it, or the dead were made to speak thereby; nay! The commandment is wholly Allah\u2019s, Have not yet those who believe known that if Allah please He would certainly guide all the people? And (as for) those who disbelieve, there will not cease to afflict them because of what they do a repelling calamity, or it will alight close by their abodes, until the promise of Allah comes about; surely Allah will not fail in (His) promise. 6:2 He it is Who created you from clay, then He decreed a term. And there is a term named with Him; still you doubt. 7:34 And for every nation there is a term, so when their term is come they shall not remain behind the least while, nor shall they go before. 10:49 Say: I do not control for myself any harm, nor any benefit except what Allah pleases. Every nation has a term. When their term comes, they shall not then remain behind for an hour, nor can they go before (their time). 71:4 He will cover for you some of your faults and grant you a delay to an appointed term. Surely the term of Allah when it comes is not postponed, did you but know. 35:11 And Allah created you from dust, then from the life-germ, then He made you pairs. And no female bears, nor does she bring forth, except with His knowledge. And no one whose life is lengthened has his life lengthened, nor is aught diminished of one\u2019s life, but it is all in a book. Surely this is easy for Allah.","title":"Fasting Part 3"},{"location":"gatherings/past/2021/fasting-3/#fasting-ramadan-in-the-noble-quran-part-3","text":"\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0648\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0645 Streamed Live 8 th May 2021","title":"Fasting &amp; Ramadan in the Noble Quran - Part 3"},{"location":"gatherings/past/2021/fasting-3/#the-ultimate-destiny","text":"In the third session, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, Shaykh Saadi Shakur, and Dr. Adnan AlAdnani discuss the final destiny of every human being.

Word by word explanation","title":"Relevant Ayat"},{"location":"gatherings/past/2021/fasting-3/#qadar-decree-and-qada-destiny-in-language","text":"Taken from the book Decree and Destiny In language qadar (measure, decree) represents both the delineation and execution of the process by which a final end - signified by qada\u2019 (destiny) - is arrived at. The connotation of processing attached to qadar contains within it the possibility of change; whereas, when a destiny ( qada\u2019 ) has come about a point of irreversibility has been reached. The divine meaning of qadar signifies \u2018creational decree\u2019, while the worldly meaning implies \u2018judgment by word or action\u2019. There is a clear differentiation between Divine qudrah (ability, power) and human qudrah , for human ability differs according to the magnitude of the task, the effort and power it needs to be executed, and is subject to time, whereas for the absolute Creator all actions are possible and effortless at all times. The following are some of the dictionary definitions of qadar and qada\u2019 : Qadar : \u2018extent, scope, quantity, scale, rate, measure, number, sum, amount, degree, grade, worth, value, standing, rank, divine decree\u2019. Qadar can also imply \u2018clarifying, distinguishing, ordering, ordaining\u2019. Qada\u2019 : \u2018severing, ending, closing, determination, conclusion, winding up, completion, accomplishment, carrying out, execution, performance, fulfillment, satisfaction, payment, passing, Divine Decree, destiny, fate, judgment\u2019. Decrees are the rules which define life\u2019s experiences on earth. Most of these rules are describable or measurable, especially those dealing with the visible realities. The rules that govern all aspects of physical (visible and experiential) existence combine with those that control the unseen forces to form a network that will result in, for example, the laws of physics. We can describe the phenomenon of light, for instance, as both a waveband and a particle called a photon. The rules somehow emerge from an unknown domain into describable, measurable, physical laws. So the decrees can be seen as a series of multitudinous models by means of which the creation, seen and unseen, is held together. Destiny is the final occurrence that is experienced by the individual through the passage of time when these laws are enacted. It is when a describable event has already passed through time. The concept of destiny is also parallel in Arabic to another term \u2018 ajal \u2019, which signifies \u2018appointed time, date, deadline, instant of death, respite, delay\u2019. If we say a business partnership has an \u2018 ajal \u2019 of five years, it means that at the end of this period it will have reached its full destiny, which is dissolution. The final destiny of every man is his awakening to his permanent non-time reality, from which he has emerged. We are given the experience of this life, with all its decrees, for us to know them, accept them and become one with them so that we can see our destiny within them, and our destiny beyond them, when time stops at the point of death.

Shari'a is the path to faithfulness for those who seek closeness to The Source, i.e. God. To find this path, an observant Muslim needs a code of behavior for everyday life that equally regulates an individual\u2019s relationship with God and with other fellow humans. As such, in Quranic verses, speaking well to and of others (Quran 23:3), compassion towards parents (Quran 2:83), and helping the orphan (Quran 2:83) are not categorically different from respecting contracts (Quran 17:34) and prohibiting homicide (Quran 17:33). They are respectively acts of good (\u1e63\u0101li\u1e25\u0101t) or evil (sayyi\u0101t) that should be performed or refrained from by believers (mu\u02beminun). Although the Quran does not distinguish between legal and moral rules, in the contemporary Islamic discourse, some legal scholars have limited the meaning of shari\u2019a to law and jurisprudence in its modern sense. Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.) said: The outer law (Shari\u2019a) is my word, The spiritual path (Tariqa) my actions, And the inner reality (Haqiqa) my inner states. This most important conversation provides context and understanding for a greatly misunderstood subject. The conversation will differentiate between Shari\u2019a and Fiqh by discussing the semitic roots of these two words and connecting them to the Noble Quran and its relevance in Ramadan. This is the last conversation of the Ramadan 2021 series within the Uncommon Dialogue and we trust it has been a wonderful month for all who participated and attended these sessions. Introduction The Arabic word shari'a means the path leading to the spring. The Quranic verse specifically referring to the word shari'a reads: \u2019Then we put thee on the Way of religion so follow thou that (Way), and follow not the desires of those who know not.\u2019 (45:18) The distinction between shari\u2019a and fiqh (jurisprudence). While shari\u2019a can be understood as an abstract concept of divine will or the path laid down by God, fiqh comes into play when divine law is derived and articulated by human scholars. Such human understanding, as mentioned above, is inevitably tainted by particular geographical and cultural characteristics of the time. Fiqh as a man-made construct of God\u2019s will is therefore not immune from difference of opinion and possibility of error. Sadly, the fallibility of fiqh is often overlooked by all sides of the discourse on the so-called shari\u2019a law. Attitudes of self-centrism and self-referentialism can be seen among both proponents of shari\u2019a and its opponents. Indeed, ignorance, oversimplification, and prejudice have hindered an open discussion about the evolution of Islamic rules throughout history. Rumi describes shari\u2019a as a candle that lights the way for those who want to begin their spiritual journey. Once the path is illuminated, the sufi continues the journey (tariqa) with an ultimate quest for truth (haqiqa). Deper Insight Allah\u2019s creation, its purpose and direction, is laid out according to perfect designs and patterns. In order for our innate nature ( fitrah ) to develop in recognizing and adhering to those inherently harmonious ways, we need to grasp the full code of the d\u012bn . The Qur\u2019an contains the foundational knowledge of that code. It unveils the way to Allah by Allah\u2019s mercy ( rahmah ) and equally identifies the cul-de-sac that draws us into confusion and destruction. It describes in detail the character, conduct and path of the believer and also the bleak picture of the non-believer. It highlights the pitfalls of the ego-self ( nafs ) and how one may sublimate and transform into an enlightened being. As well as addressing the individual, the Qur\u2019an also addresses mankind on a social level through the many references to nations being destroyed by their wrong deeds. Allah, His ways, commands, and prohibitions contain the most prominent regulatory patterns in natural creation. Everything in existence has been designed perfectly, and human endeavor is needed to uncover and apply the appropriate ways of interacting in the world. In Allah\u2019s creation, more specific general laws and decrees have been highlighted. These laws and decrees were revealed to the prophets and messengers \u2013 who were enlightened beings \u2013 with appropriate paths of leadership and governance for their times. The d\u012bn includes matters of faith and transformative worship as well as appropriate codes of conduct. The prophetic character of Muhammad, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was the perfect example of living Islam. Human search, struggle and high aspiration for perfection and beauty will continue forever. Experiencing the Garden in this world is only a temporary reflection of paradise in the Hereafter. The d\u012bn of Islam, based on the Qur\u2019an and the prophetic way, is the map that will take us from this world of change and uncertainty to the abode of eternal bliss and happiness. This map reveals the boundaries and the direction that will lead us back to our home where Adam and Eve came into being. Our d\u012bn is a way life, a way of thinking, a way of eating, a way of worshipping, a way of transacting, and a way of relationships. Every aspect has the appropriate courtesy. To begin with, for a child it\u2019s a bit difficult because he does not immediately see the benefit that he shouldn\u2019t eat while he is walking; he shouldn\u2019t drink while he is running, and so on. But as he gets older he finds that these practices are beneficial because he does not get indigestion. All of these virtues, which are a result of practicing the d\u012bn , are of immediate direct benefit. We are living at a time when society cannot help the family and individual very much because of the smaller households, and all of the other demands of pleasures and frivolous distractions. Therefore, simply giving orders to young people to follow rituals will not work. But if they realize that they can excel in their studies and exams by perfecting their sajda (prostration), how to disappear and have no thought in it, they will certainly do their salat (prayers) more enjoyably, and more on time. They will not miss it. There are benefits of salat at every level. So we need to live our d\u012bn , and to absorb the benefits of every aspect of the Qur`an and Prophetic teaching. We must be the first beneficiaries, otherwise we will be preaching without partaking ourselves, and that is hypocrisy. That is what so many so-called religious communities suffer from. So the second course introduces us to the d\u012bn , the shari\u02bba , the way of life: the way of thinking, moving, transacting; what is correct, what is allowed and what is not; what is forbidden completely and what is despicable and to be avoided. It is all for our own sake. Allah does not need it. You and I need it in order to realize the light of Allah in our hearts. The course shows us how to transform vices into virtues, and how every aspect of the shari\u02bba is designed to bring about a shift and elevation in the level of our consciousness and awareness. All outer acts of worship in all religions must help a person to arrive at a deep understanding of inner meanings and the true purpose underlying such acts; otherwise, they remain empty rituals bereft of meaning. Worship is the ultimate demonstration of a person\u2019s adoration and love for the object of worship, who is nothing less than the One Source of everything. The yearning to worship is ingrained within our soul. By performing the ritual acts of worship we are attempting to unify our mind, body and actions to work together with the Divine attributes that are so deeply loved and desired. All ritual worship, in effect, is an attempt to be in unison with Divine consciousness. Rituals, Intention, Attention Appropriate Action Taken from Shaykh Fadhlalla's book Transformative Worship in Islam: Experiencing Perfection . Islam provides details of numerous \u2018necessary\u2019 or obligatory practices and rituals for individuals and communities. The Qur\u2019an and the Islamic way of life provide the spiritual path, maps and codes which may unlock the durable common purpose and meaning of life on earth. All acts of worship begin with self-awareness and a desire for higher knowledge. The preparation for worship is the declaration of intent and the hope to be focused, attentive and engaged in the process of a deepening one\u2019s state of awareness. A point may arrive when the worshiper loses concerns with worldly mundane matters and begins to experience subtler levels of awareness which are deeper than the normal day to day variety. The ultimate purpose of worship and prayer is to experientially realize a state that is not subject to earthly or mental limitations. This may be variously identified as the sacred void, inner bliss, pure peace, or ultimate or higher consciousness. Islam is the path of unity between one\u2019s intentions and actions. It begins with a declaration by the tongue, reflecting a sincere heart. A Muslim is someone who professes that there is one God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of that one God. Knowledge of this truth will become clearer in time. Recognition of this condition gives rise to a formal expression of worship for which preparation is required. Our natural needs in life will make us supplicate, invoke and pray for God\u2019s power to relieve us from needs, pains and fears. Communal supplications and prayers increase the power of the act. There are special occasions, times and places, that are auspicious, such as the nights of power during the month of fasting \u2013 Ramadan. There are also sacred places where acts of worship are enhanced. The symbolic house of God was established by the Prophet Abraham in Makkah, where people walk around ( taw\u0101f ) the Ka`bah and pray in its precinct. Jerusalem is another major center for prayer and pilgrimage. The practices of regular and formal prayers, fasting, pilgrimage, payment of wealth tax, performing good actions, and exerting outer and inner struggle to reform the self, are part of the essential package of Islam. Cleanliness of body, mind and heart are essential preconditions to acts of prayer and worship. Equally important is to eat and drink modestly of that which is prescribed as pure and clean. There are clear boundaries and restrictions to be observed on our senses and actions. Outer limitations hint at the limitlessness of the inner. It is important for human beings to realize that we need God\u2019s grace and mercy at all times, and that it can be received when we are ready and receptive. Restrictions and shortages are nature\u2019s way to limit our egotistic excesses. The foundation of the d\u012bn , metaphorically and practically, is based upon the mystery of Oneness, which pervades universally. A mature human being can approach this goal after having attained reasonable spiritual confidence within one\u2019s own self. If you are not unified within your mind, heart, and intentions then \u2018tawh\u012bd\u2019 remains a vague idea, rather than a present reality. It is only a unified person who can be at the door of sacred unity. The success of any action very much depends upon the original intention and preparation. If you start to build an edifice by laying the correct foundation and continue in that disciplined manner you will have a handsome house. But if the building proceeds haphazardly, you will be left with a ramshackle building. Living faith is about willing submission to the truth of one reality: Allah. The faithful seeker witnesses countless transient realities in this world but his focus is on the never-changing truth behind the changeable. His adoration and worship is preceded by yearning, calling, pleading, praying, and undertaking appropriate action. The best of actions are those that reduce personal desires and earthly attachments. As human beings in constant interaction with the world of causalities, we benefit by preparing to disengage from worldly demands in order to be more receptive to the inner world of lights and subtle insights. In doing so, we do not deny the gross reality, but balance the emphasis between the seen and the unseen. The Adamic reality contains an indefinable source of life called the soul/spirit ( r\u016bh ) and a self ( nafs ) that connects the soul with the physical world through senses and limbs. The spiritual path is based upon making the self subservient to the soul which will provide higher guidance through the inner light that shines through a purified heart. The main objective, then, is to know the nature of the self, guarding over it with vigilance, holding it to account and treating it with the proper remedies. Progress in directing one\u2019s conduct and actions towards noble traits will result in greater awareness of the self and awakening to ever-increasing insights and knowledges. The basis of shari`ah is to restrict the tendencies of the lower self in order for the higher (consciousness) to be the leader and guide for appropriate intentions and actions needed for wholesome living. The thrill of experiencing the inner light of the soul will then lead the seeker towards perfecting worship and maintaining a high level of self-awareness and clear boundaries for actions. Thus, higher consciousness will lift all the veils and shadows which were the cause of previous confusions and darkness. A paradigm shift in behavior will be the clear sign of enlightenment. Relevant Ayat 42:13 He has laid down for you as religion that He charged Noah with, and that We have revealed to thee, and that We charged Abraham with, Moses and Jesus: 'Perform the religion, and scatter not regarding it. Very hateful is that for the idolaters, that thou callest them to. God chooses unto Himself whomsoever He will, and He guides to Himself whosoever turns, penitent. 5:48 And We have sent down to thee the Book with the truth, confirming the Book that was before it, and assuring it. So judge between them according to what God has sent down, and do not follow their caprices, to forsake the truth that has come to thee. To every one of you We have appointed a right way and an open road. If God had willed, He would have made you one nation; but that He may try you in what has come to you. So be you forward in good works; unto God shall you return, all together; and He will tell you of that whereon you were at variance. 45:18 Then We set thee upon an open way of the Command; therefore follow it, and follow not the caprices of those who do not know. 9:122 And it is not for the believers to go forth [to battle] all at once. For there should separate from every division of them a group [remaining] to obtain understanding in the religion and warn their people when they return to them that they might be cautious. 7:179 And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless. 72:16 And that if they should keep to the (right) way, We would certainly give them to drink of abundant water, 46:30 They said, 'Our people, we have heard a Book that was sent down after Moses, confirming what was before it, guiding to the truth and to a straight path. 33:38 There is not to be upon the Prophet any discomfort concerning that which Allah has imposed upon him. [This is] the established way of Allah with those [prophets] who have passed on before. And ever is the command of Allah a destiny decreed. 28:85 Most surely He Who has made the Quran binding on you will bring you back to the destination. Say: My Lord knows best him who has brought the guidance and him who is in manifest error. 2:183 O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become reverent 2:110 And establish prayer and give zakah, and whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with Allah. Indeed, Allah of what you do, is Seeing. 5:6 O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles. And if you are in a state of janabah, then purify yourselves. But if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and do not find water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it. Allah does not intend to make difficulty for you, but He intends to purify you and complete His favor upon you that you may be grateful. 2:177 Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in Allah , the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets and gives wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives zakah; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous. 98:5 And they were not commanded except to worship Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth, and to establish prayer and to give zakah. And that is the correct religion. 7:29 Say: 'My Lord has commanded justice. Set your faces in every place of worship and call on Him, making your religion sincerely His. As He originated you so you will return; 16:90 Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded. 2:187 Permitted to you, upon the night of the Fast, is to go in to your wives; -- they are a vestment for you, and you are a vestment for them. God knows that you have been betraying yourselves, and has turned to you and pardoned you. So now lie with them, and seek what God has prescribed for you. And eat and drink, until the white thread shows clearly to you from the black thread at the dawn; then complete the Fast unto the night, and do not lie with them while you cleave to the mosques. Those are God's bounds; keep well within them. So God makes clear His signs to men; haply they will be reverent. 2:173 He has only forbidden to you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit], there is no sin upon him. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. 2:275 Those who devour usury shall not rise again except as he rises, whom Satan of the touch prostrates; that is because they say, 'Trafficking (trade) is like usury.' God has permitted trafficking, and forbidden usury. Whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and gives over, he shall have his past gains, and his affair is committed to God; but whosoever reverts -- those are the inhabitants of the Fire, therein dwelling forever. 6:151 Say, \"Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you. [He commands] that you not associate anything with Him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them. And do not approach immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed. And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed] except by [legal] right. This has He instructed you that you may use reason.\"","title":"Fasting Part 4"},{"location":"gatherings/past/2021/fasting-4/#fasting-ramadan-in-the-noble-quran-part-4","text":"\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0648\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0645 Streamed Live Tuesday May 11 th 2021","title":"Fasting &amp; Ramadan in the Noble Quran - Part 4"},{"location":"gatherings/past/2021/fasting-4/#the-pathways-to-the-boundless","text":"In this session, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, Shaykh Saadi Shakur, and Dr. Adnan Aladnani discuss shari\u2019a : The Pathways to The Boundless. Shari'a is the path to faithfulness for those who seek closeness to The Source, i.e. God. To find this path, an observant Muslim needs a code of behavior for everyday life that equally regulates an individual\u2019s relationship with God and with other fellow humans. As such, in Quranic verses, speaking well to and of others (Quran 23:3), compassion towards parents (Quran 2:83), and helping the orphan (Quran 2:83) are not categorically different from respecting contracts (Quran 17:34) and prohibiting homicide (Quran 17:33). They are respectively acts of good (\u1e63\u0101li\u1e25\u0101t) or evil (sayyi\u0101t) that should be performed or refrained from by believers (mu\u02beminun). Although the Quran does not distinguish between legal and moral rules, in the contemporary Islamic discourse, some legal scholars have limited the meaning of shari\u2019a to law and jurisprudence in its modern sense. Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.) said: The outer law (Shari\u2019a) is my word, The spiritual path (Tariqa) my actions, And the inner reality (Haqiqa) my inner states. This most important conversation provides context and understanding for a greatly misunderstood subject. The conversation will differentiate between Shari\u2019a and Fiqh by discussing the semitic roots of these two words and connecting them to the Noble Quran and its relevance in Ramadan. This is the last conversation of the Ramadan 2021 series within the Uncommon Dialogue and we trust it has been a wonderful month for all who participated and attended these sessions.","title":"The Pathways To The Boundless"},{"location":"gatherings/past/2021/fasting-4/#introduction","text":"The Arabic word shari'a means the path leading to the spring.

Fiqh as a man-made construct of God\u2019s will is therefore not immune from difference of opinion and possibility of error. Sadly, the fallibility of fiqh is often overlooked by all sides of the discourse on the so-called shari\u2019a law. Attitudes of self-centrism and self-referentialism can be seen among both proponents of shari\u2019a and its opponents. Indeed, ignorance, oversimplification, and prejudice have hindered an open discussion about the evolution of Islamic rules throughout history. Rumi describes shari\u2019a as a candle that lights the way for those who want to begin their spiritual journey.

In order for our innate nature ( fitrah ) to develop in recognizing and adhering to those inherently harmonious ways, we need to grasp the full code of the d\u012bn . The Qur\u2019an contains the foundational knowledge of that code. It unveils the way to Allah by Allah\u2019s mercy ( rahmah ) and equally identifies the cul-de-sac that draws us into confusion and destruction. It describes in detail the character, conduct and path of the believer and also the bleak picture of the non-believer. It highlights the pitfalls of the ego-self ( nafs ) and how one may sublimate and transform into an enlightened being. As well as addressing the individual, the Qur\u2019an also addresses mankind on a social level through the many references to nations being destroyed by their wrong deeds. Allah, His ways, commands, and prohibitions contain the most prominent regulatory patterns in natural creation. Everything in existence has been designed perfectly, and human endeavor is needed to uncover and apply the appropriate ways of interacting in the world. In Allah\u2019s creation, more specific general laws and decrees have been highlighted. These laws and decrees were revealed to the prophets and messengers \u2013 who were enlightened beings \u2013 with appropriate paths of leadership and governance for their times. The d\u012bn includes matters of faith and transformative worship as well as appropriate codes of conduct. The prophetic character of Muhammad, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was the perfect example of living Islam. Human search, struggle and high aspiration for perfection and beauty will continue forever. Experiencing the Garden in this world is only a temporary reflection of paradise in the Hereafter. The d\u012bn of Islam, based on the Qur\u2019an and the prophetic way, is the map that will take us from this world of change and uncertainty to the abode of eternal bliss and happiness. This map reveals the boundaries and the direction that will lead us back to our home where Adam and Eve came into being. Our d\u012bn is a way life, a way of thinking, a way of eating, a way of worshipping, a way of transacting, and a way of relationships. Every aspect has the appropriate courtesy. To begin with, for a child it\u2019s a bit difficult because he does not immediately see the benefit that he shouldn\u2019t eat while he is walking; he shouldn\u2019t drink while he is running, and so on. But as he gets older he finds that these practices are beneficial because he does not get indigestion. All of these virtues, which are a result of practicing the d\u012bn , are of immediate direct benefit. We are living at a time when society cannot help the family and individual very much because of the smaller households, and all of the other demands of pleasures and frivolous distractions. Therefore, simply giving orders to young people to follow rituals will not work. But if they realize that they can excel in their studies and exams by perfecting their sajda (prostration), how to disappear and have no thought in it, they will certainly do their salat (prayers) more enjoyably, and more on time. They will not miss it. There are benefits of salat at every level. So we need to live our d\u012bn , and to absorb the benefits of every aspect of the Qur`an and Prophetic teaching. We must be the first beneficiaries, otherwise we will be preaching without partaking ourselves, and that is hypocrisy. That is what so many so-called religious communities suffer from. So the second course introduces us to the d\u012bn , the shari\u02bba , the way of life: the way of thinking, moving, transacting; what is correct, what is allowed and what is not; what is forbidden completely and what is despicable and to be avoided. It is all for our own sake. Allah does not need it. You and I need it in order to realize the light of Allah in our hearts. The course shows us how to transform vices into virtues, and how every aspect of the shari\u02bba is designed to bring about a shift and elevation in the level of our consciousness and awareness. All outer acts of worship in all religions must help a person to arrive at a deep understanding of inner meanings and the true purpose underlying such acts; otherwise, they remain empty rituals bereft of meaning. Worship is the ultimate demonstration of a person\u2019s adoration and love for the object of worship, who is nothing less than the One Source of everything. The yearning to worship is ingrained within our soul. By performing the ritual acts of worship we are attempting to unify our mind, body and actions to work together with the Divine attributes that are so deeply loved and desired. All ritual worship, in effect, is an attempt to be in unison with Divine consciousness.","title":"Deper Insight"},{"location":"gatherings/past/2021/fasting-4/#rituals-intention-attention-appropriate-action","text":"Taken from Shaykh Fadhlalla's book Transformative Worship in Islam: Experiencing Perfection .

As He originated you so you will return; 16:90 Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded. 2:187 Permitted to you, upon the night of the Fast, is to go in to your wives; -- they are a vestment for you, and you are a vestment for them. God knows that you have been betraying yourselves, and has turned to you and pardoned you. So now lie with them, and seek what God has prescribed for you. And eat and drink, until the white thread shows clearly to you from the black thread at the dawn; then complete the Fast unto the night, and do not lie with them while you cleave to the mosques. Those are God's bounds; keep well within them. So God makes clear His signs to men; haply they will be reverent. 2:173 He has only forbidden to you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit], there is no sin upon him. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. 2:275 Those who devour usury shall not rise again except as he rises, whom Satan of the touch prostrates; that is because they say, 'Trafficking (trade) is like usury.' God has permitted trafficking, and forbidden usury. Whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and gives over, he shall have his past gains, and his affair is committed to God; but whosoever reverts -- those are the inhabitants of the Fire, therein dwelling forever. 6:151 Say, \"Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you. [He commands] that you not associate anything with Him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them. And do not approach immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed. And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed] except by [legal] right.

We have many questions relating to the individual and community. Anything we experience in this life is part of this duality. There are thousands of complementary dualities. The individual and community, the micro and the macro, the one and the many, I and the rest. Premiered on Sunday 18 th April 2021 There are thousands of complementary dualities. The individual and community, the micro and the macro, the one and the many, I and the rest. They either enhance or demolish each other. The virtues of an individual can also be the virtues of a community or society or a nation viz; kindness, generosity, patient, accommodating or respectful. All of these things that an individual can feel or do can be done as a family or a clan or a community. The individual can be nasty, mean, destructive and so can a group of people, communities. All of this goes up and down in cycles. A group of people who were mean and destructive, raiding, killing, and pillaging could after a dozen generations of suffering and other factors can become most accommodating, gentle, generous, and hospitable with a good quality of life. This session reflects upon the one and the many and the connectedness between them and how they enhance each other how they can destroy each other. Being a spiritual person is synonymous with being a person whose highest priority is to be loving to yourself and others. A spiritual person cares about people, animals, and the planet.

The Abrahamic traditions are the result of thousands of prophets and messengers coming to guide humankind, culminating with the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), whose gift of the Noble Qur\u2019an is of universal value. The potent message of the Qur\u2019an connects infinite, unseen, cosmic lights with finite, relative, and limited earthly consciousness. The miracle of the Qur\u2019an is that its verses repeatedly reveal the seamless connection between heavenly powers and earthly limitations. The Universal Quran: Selected Verses for All Times is an attempt to present key verses which are universally useful for all times and for all people for every moment in the human journey. The selections made reflect the major themes of existential reality \u2013 eternal life manifesting in cyclicality and dualities, the layered consciousness and the arc of its trajectory, the keys to wholesome living, all embedded in the web of cosmic oneness and reflected in the human embodiment of awakening. Shaykh Saadi Shakur, Syed Haider Mehdi, and Dr. Adnan AlAdnani continued to engage with Shaykh Fadhlalla, discussing the 'wise commentary and rendering of these verses as a wake-up call for all humanity, regardless of belief or philosophy of life'. Shaykh Fadhlalla outlined some key matters framing the future series of discussions on the Universal Quran in which the six chapters of this book will be unpacked. Livestreamed on May 16 th , May 23 rd , and June 5 th 2021 Background This is the age where we need regular spiritual recharge and awakening to the truth within our hearts. The Noble Qur\u2019an is universal and useful at all times and for all people. This belief motivated Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri to select the verses that are clearly universal. Shaykh Fadhlalla rendered the meanings of the verses in an easily accessible way for the modern reader. The verses selected are renderings of the inner meaning, rather than a traditional translation. The present needs of human beings in this day and age require more reference to the Source of creation, and Divine Light \u2013 which are largely Meccan verses, of which this book presents a selection. The selected verses help with personal transformation and the rise in consciousness and Universal Truth, rather than with relationship, community, law, and other aspects of conduct to help recharge spiritually.

The Qur'an provides more insight: \u201cSay: Travel in the earth and see how He makes the first creation, then Allah creates the latter creation; surely Allah has power over all things.\u201d \u2013 29:20 In every way it is a blessing to travel. In the Shadhili tariqa , the masters never slept in one place for more than three weeks, so as not to take what was around them for granted. Haraka ma\u2019a-l-baraka : movement is with blessing. Man must change, he must move on so that he does not become a slave of outer habits and become fixated. Man is attracted to fixation because he loves the permanent, the ever-fixed within him. But to desire preservation of outer fixation is ignorance. The outer can never be fixed. No sooner does man try to control an event than he finds it beyond his power to do so. Man wants to know the permanent but he mistakenly tries to bring it about in his environment by establishing rigid habits. At the lowest, most superficial level, travel disturbs this tendency. The earth would be sterile if it were not disturbed, if it were not plowed. The same thing applies to man\u2019s heart. If it is not disturbed, if it is not cut off from its desires and attachments, how can it resonate and keep turning? At first one resents being cut off, but the purpose of one\u2019s life is to move both outwardly and inwardly; outwardly by having dynamic attitudes toward the world and the earth, and inwardly by being willing to turn away from what the self desires. Hajj The word hajj literally means \"endeavor, aspiration, intention, destination, object, goal, aim\". In Islam it means: \u2018to intend to go to the House of Allah to carry out specific rituals which are to be executed within a certain time frame.\u2019 In a spiritual sense hajj is endeavoring to reach a station whose meaning, magnitude and true essence cannot be expressed or explained because of the lack of words to describe it. For this reason there are few who speak of it. In The Lantern of the Path , Imam Ja`far al\u2011Sadiq said: \"If you want to make the Pilgrimage then empty your heart before your departure of every distraction and concealing veil and turn all your affairs over to your Creator and trust in Him\u2026\" \"\u2026then wash your sins away with the water of sincere repentance and don the garments of truth, purity and humility.\" `Umrah This is the voluntary visit to the Ka`bah at other times of the year. The word `umrah is from the Arabic three letter root `AMR, which means to construct, build and inhabit, implying \u2018flourishing, inhabiting, giving life to, populating, and building\u2019. Thus, `umrah means to cause to flourish and to be enlivened by one\u2019s presence at the Ka`bah. The Ka`bah is a metaphor for divine impenetrability and for this reason there is no fear for the one who is present there. It is the Fortress of Eternal Truth \u2013 everlasting and perfect. Whoever performs the `Umrah is not obliged to perform the Pause at `Arafah, but only the Taw\u0101f and the Hastening Between Stations, and does not leave Makkah before visiting the House many times. This represents the passion for Allah\u2019s Names and Attributes which encompass the universe and the Ka`bah is its centre. Going to Madinah and to the Presence of Muhammad is not considered complementary to the House of Allah, because the prophetic presence is a manifestation of the Presence of Oneness. The enlightened seeker sees through the Muhammadi Presence, and his spiritual insight witnesses the Presence of Oneness \u2013 the Unique Absolute One. As his outer is within the shari`ah, his soul is within the tariqah and his Innermost is within the haqiqah. Reflecting upon \u2018Muhammad the Messenger of Allah \u2019 will reveal that \u2018Muhammad\u2019 represents the Physical Universe and the \u2018Messenger\u2019 (ras\u016bl) represents the Spiritual Realms, and that \u2018Allah\u2019 represents the Realm of Power. Thus, whoever knows the haqiqah of Muhammad knows the entire truth. Muhrim The muhrim (one who is in a state of ihr\u0101m ) journeys in a state of complete obedience, calling out the words of the talbiyah : \"Labayka\" (Here I am, at Your service!), until s/he arrives at the Ka`bah, the House of Allah, which is a state of Oneness. Then s/he discontinues the call because of having completely vanished within the House: his/her presence melts into the unique oneness of the House, which is the focus of all creation. The black stone is a metaphor of universal relationships. It is a representation of star dust which is the structure of our earth and our bodies. Al-Ihr\u0101m This is considered the first of the four spiritual Pillars of the Pilgrimage. It is the act of entering the process of the Pilgrimage. It is thus called because the person making the pilgrimage abstains from shaving, cutting fingernails, hunting, and having sexual relations. It also refers to the donning of a garment, usually of white cotton, wool or linen, worn during the performance of the Pilgrimage. Its significance is that all things which are permitted (hal\u0101l) are forbidden (har\u0101m), in addition to what is already forbidden, to the person of this station while he is wearing the white garment, out of reverence for the sanctity of Allah. The people of gnosis consider it to mean the exodus from every circumstance, whether it be exalted or lowly or whether it be related to time or space. This is often referred to as \u2018Freedom from Surroundings\u2019. If the person of this station does not exit from the limitations of time and space and from the external world of phenomena he will not arrive at his destination. All human experiences occur within the realm of phenomena. Outside of it there is no time or space, because Allah existed when there was no time and no space, and He remains unchanged. This entire realm of existence, with respect to His Magnitude and Glory, is no more than a mustard seed or smaller. Taw\u0101f This is the second of the four spiritual Pillars of Pilgrimage. The word in this context signifies the return to the Manifestation of the Essence which is worthy of Divinity ( ul\u016bhiyah ), and which is described in terms related to meaning and spirituality, travelling through the realm of meaning, and the various qualities of the manifestations of the Creator and the creation. The taw\u0101f is also a journey of reflection into the inter-relatedness of the seven key Attributes (Living, Knowing, Willing, Able, Communicating, Seeing, Hearing), the characteristics of their composition, and the dependence of one upon the other. When the pilgrim enters the Sanctuary he finds the six directions (i.e. north, south, east, west, above and below) all facing towards the Ka`bah. If it is like this for the seeker, how is it for the Master who has vanished within the Essence of his Creator and who represents Allah in his words? Everything which issues forth from the tongues of the Masters comes from the beams issuing forth from the Presence of the Unique Oneness. Sa`y This is the third of the four spiritual pillars of the pilgrimage. Hastening between the stations of the Pilgrimage, which are called Saf\u0101 and Marwa , refers to the fluctuation of the Master between Allah\u2019s Beauty ( jam\u0101l ) and His Glory and Majesty ( jal\u0101l ) to the point where Glory becomes the essence of Beauty because of his having abandoned his self, not to mention his own will and freedom of choice. This fluctuation between Beauty and Majesty represents the Masters\u2019 rank of perfection. Their movement represents the Hand of Allah\u2019s concern and His protection in both states. In spite of the lofty position of the Masters, they are not seduced by what they have already attained from the taw\u0101f and their immersion in the Presence of Oneness. Majesty and Beauty do not affect them because they are part of them, in contrast to others for whom this state would represent a tribulation. He who is with Allah loves Allah\u2019s constriction as well as His expansion, and sees both of them as being natural occurrences like night and day, as they are both necessary conditions of experiencing being-ness. Constriction is an attribute of the physical while expansion is an attribute of the spiritual. The Master lets the station seek him out and does not try to seek it out. The station was created for him he was not created for the station. He is concerned exclusively with the glorification of Allah and allows everything else to serve him in his dedication. Wuq\u016bf This is the stopping place or Pause of the Pilgrimage on the plains of \u2018Arafat. As the Prophet said: \"The Pilgrimage is `Arafah.\" After completing Taw\u0101f and Sa`y , the Master is overcome by a state above which there is no higher condition or increase, which is the abandonment of anything known to him beyond the ability to describe. In this station of absolute abandonment, he is ordered to give up his physical form, his soul, his self, his reasoning, the names as well as the Attributes, and anything which has the scent of manifestation; he is commanded to gatheredness and to enfold the outward within the inward and the inward in the outward. When he has realized this state then he has completed the climb up the mountain, which is referred to as the Pause. It is also referred to as \u2018The Blindness\u2019 because it is absolute non\u2011existence, witnessing neither creation nor Creator. The Pause is a station beyond reasoning, and therefore impossible to express, that it has been called the \u2018obscure\u2019, the \u2018amazement\u2019, the \u2018bewilderment\u2019, the \u2018obliteration\u2019, and the \u2018Realm of L\u0101h\u016bt \u2019 (Pure Unity). People of Allah are in wonderment at the mention of it, unable to describe it as if they were deaf and dumb and powerless to reason. `Arafah, then, is the station of the Pause and the final goal of total annihilation (or complete vanishing from existence). The Pause occurs after zuhr (midday prayer time) and after the vanishing of existence ( zaww\u0101l ): \"When the sun is rolled up and the stars are cast adrift.\" Qur'an, 81:1\u20112 This is the station of obliteration and blindness, of which the Prophet said: \"Indeed, it is the station of blindness (with) no atmosphere above it or below it.\" As this station is incomprehensible and full of awe one must exit from it as soon as possible, remaining merely for a pause. The seeker must then hasten to the place of nearness: Muzdalifah . \"Flee from it (`Arafah) to the Place of Nearness (Muzdalifah) lest you vanish within it.\" Thus, it is cried out in bewilderment: \"O my Lord, from the standpoint of the Truth of Existence, You are the Worshipper and You are the Worshipped, You are the Witness and the Witnessed.\" After this, the seeker must hasten to Makkah, which is referred to as the Presence of Oneness, in order to cease his wandering, attain a sense of security, bathe, and pray his sunrise prayer. This concludes all four spiritual Pillars of the Pilgrimage. A\u1e63-\u1e63af\u0101 and Al-marwah Throughout your life you run back and forth between two opposite things, like a\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101 and al-Marwah . A\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101 and al-Marwah are two clusters of rocks between which the pilgrim runs back and forth. They are the scene of Hajar\u2019s running to and fro in search of water, after being left alone with \u2018Ismail in the blistering heat and wilderness of Mecca. They figuratively bracket all human efforts, from hunger to fullness, from illness to wellness, and man\u2019s patience and tawakkul (trust, confidence) in Allah are tested through running between them. A\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101 and al-Marwah , and the practice of sa\u2019y (running between the two of them), are indeed true signs of Allah. Man performs sa\u2019y throughout his life in his constant search for true contentment, seeking it outwardly, not knowing that the access to it is already within him.","title":"Journey Words"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#journey-words","text":"","title":"Journey Words"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#sair","text":"The most direct translation of this word is \"travel\".

In the Shadhili tariqa , the masters never slept in one place for more than three weeks, so as not to take what was around them for granted. Haraka ma\u2019a-l-baraka : movement is with blessing. Man must change, he must move on so that he does not become a slave of outer habits and become fixated. Man is attracted to fixation because he loves the permanent, the ever-fixed within him. But to desire preservation of outer fixation is ignorance. The outer can never be fixed. No sooner does man try to control an event than he finds it beyond his power to do so. Man wants to know the permanent but he mistakenly tries to bring it about in his environment by establishing rigid habits. At the lowest, most superficial level, travel disturbs this tendency. The earth would be sterile if it were not disturbed, if it were not plowed. The same thing applies to man\u2019s heart. If it is not disturbed, if it is not cut off from its desires and attachments, how can it resonate and keep turning? At first one resents being cut off, but the purpose of one\u2019s life is to move both outwardly and inwardly; outwardly by having dynamic attitudes toward the world and the earth, and inwardly by being willing to turn away from what the self desires.","title":"Sa\u2019ir"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#hajj","text":"The word hajj literally means \"endeavor, aspiration, intention, destination, object, goal, aim\".

For this reason there are few who speak of it. In The Lantern of the Path , Imam Ja`far al\u2011Sadiq said: \"If you want to make the Pilgrimage then empty your heart before your departure of every distraction and concealing veil and turn all your affairs over to your Creator and trust in Him\u2026\" \"\u2026then wash your sins away with the water of sincere repentance and don the garments of truth, purity and humility.\"","title":"Hajj"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#umrah","text":"This is the voluntary visit to the Ka`bah at other times of the year. The word `umrah is from the Arabic three letter root `AMR, which means to construct, build and inhabit, implying \u2018flourishing, inhabiting, giving life to, populating, and building\u2019. Thus, `umrah means to cause to flourish and to be enlivened by one\u2019s presence at the Ka`bah. The Ka`bah is a metaphor for divine impenetrability and for this reason there is no fear for the one who is present there. It is the Fortress of Eternal Truth \u2013 everlasting and perfect. Whoever performs the `Umrah is not obliged to perform the Pause at `Arafah, but only the Taw\u0101f and the Hastening Between Stations, and does not leave Makkah before visiting the House many times. This represents the passion for Allah\u2019s Names and Attributes which encompass the universe and the Ka`bah is its centre. Going to Madinah and to the Presence of Muhammad is not considered complementary to the House of Allah, because the prophetic presence is a manifestation of the Presence of Oneness. The enlightened seeker sees through the Muhammadi Presence, and his spiritual insight witnesses the Presence of Oneness \u2013 the Unique Absolute One. As his outer is within the shari`ah, his soul is within the tariqah and his Innermost is within the haqiqah. Reflecting upon \u2018Muhammad the Messenger of Allah \u2019 will reveal that \u2018Muhammad\u2019 represents the Physical Universe and the \u2018Messenger\u2019 (ras\u016bl) represents the Spiritual Realms, and that \u2018Allah\u2019 represents the Realm of Power.

Fa\u1e6dara also means \"to create\". Non-creation cracked and split open to reveal its opposite, creation. Basic knowledge is Fi\u1e6dr\u012b, connected with the pre-creational crack. Access to Basic knowledge is through diving deep into the well to reach the source of the spring where the original crack is. The Saf\u012bh, the foolish, ignorant one whose life is cluttered and whose well is filled up with the debris of illusions, desires, attachments and covetousness, has no access to that original crack, that fi\u1e6drah. R\u016b\u1e25 R\u016b\u1e25 means \u201cspirit, soul.\u201d It is related to r\u012b\u1e25 , which means \u201cwind.\u201d R\u0101\u1e25ah , which means \u201ccomfort, contentment, or ease,\u201d also comes from the same root, as does the word r\u0101\u2019i\u1e25ah , which means \u201cperfume\u201d and mirwa\u1e25ah , which means \u201cfan.\u201d The implication here is that the spirit is like a wind; it is as subtle as a summer breeze. The spirit is blown into the body and later blown out of it. Like the wind, its subtlety is balanced by its forcefulness. It says in the Qur\u2019an: \u201cThey ask you about the soul. Say: the soul is one of the commands of my Lord\u201d (17:85). On that Night of Power the All-Mighty, All-Powerful Lord extends His mercy of knowledge and opens up the skies, and the angelic powers and forces fulfill their merciful duty of bringing forth clearly the message and knowledge of taw\u1e25\u012bd and the command and control of the Lord. Sajdah Closeness to Allah is by sajdah, by prostration, which is the outer proof of inner abandonment. Outer prostration is the manifestation of an inner state; if it is not, it becomes an empty ritual. Sajada, the root of sajdah, also means \u201cto obey,\u201d meaning to obey the purpose of existence. The purpose of existence is merciful and benign. Another meaning of sajada is \u201cto submit,\u201d and through that submission comes freedom. The only freedom is the recognition of no freedom. The only freedom is the direct inner recognition that there is absolutely no possibility of freedom. From that comes the ultimate freedom and release which is the real and infinite freedom, freedom that is beyond our creation and after our end. Our purpose is to be in that state of inward drunkenness and outward sobriety, inward abandonment and outward courtesy and correctness. In this state we become awareness itself, not aware of something. This then is the outer manifestation of sajdah, of prostration, which is spontaneous. It is the only human position and it is the final as well as the first human position. Fajr Fajr means \u201cdawn, the first light of the morning.\u201d Fajara, the root of fajr, means \u201cto crack, to break out, to explode.\u201d The state of the heart of the knower is hidden in the darkness of the night but is illumined inwardly. It is outwardly in darkness yet bright with inner light, outwardly quiet but inwardly active and dynamic in the sea of knowledge. Most spiritual work is done from late at night until the dawn, when outwardly there is the least physical action and therefore a maximum possibility for inner action. The root of everything lies in its opposite. The root of the most beautiful, soft, white, ravishing lily lies in mud just as the root of maximal inner action lies in outer quietude. From the knowledge that all creation exists according to a measure and is moving toward a destiny according to that measure, comes the peace of certainty. This inner certainty, which illumines all possible outer manifestations, brings about an equilibrium and balance that renders the awakened being in a state full of harmony and unity. The meaning of that peace, which is the result of knowledge, resides inherently in every heart. For the seed to be unearthed, the heart must be purified and made open. The seeker of the knowledge of Allah spends his days of darkness and nights of vigil awaiting the descent of the opening, and when that occurs it is like the crack of dawn. Dhikr The Arabic word for remembrance is dhikr . Remembrance is of several types or levels. There is the remembrance of physical things, which are in front of us, and there is the remembrance of one\u2019s desires, anxieties, and so on. Along the spiritual path, remembrance relates to that which is in one\u2019s innate nature. It is the remembrance of the Essence of Allah the Almighty, of the Source of all manifestations and attributes. That source is within everybody. On the Sufi path, one is required to dis-remember everything else that is discernible, everything that is other than Allah, in order to return to the original remembrance. The Arabic word for remembrance of Allah is dhikru\u2019llah. So the original remembrance of Allah is already in every heart, whether one is aware of it or not. Through the guidance of a spiritual master, the seeker is led beyond, to a level where there is no remembrance of anything that is mentionable. Then that which has always been there, encompassing everything, is eventually experienced and witnessed. The purpose of Sufi practices is to be spontaneously aware of the absolute or central reality as well as remaining aware of the physical and material limitations of the phenomenal world which surrounds us. One is an inner awareness beyond the senses and the other is an outer awareness which is based on senses. Qadr and Qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 \"Certainly, We sent it down on the Night of the Decree.\" The Power that created all the creational systems made them according to a measure, the Decree or qadr , by which all creational manifestations are brought to their destiny, qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 , and final judgment. In the above ayat we are given a glimpse into an aspect of the meaning of qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 wa qadr (destiny and decree). Qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 means \u201cfate, destiny, judgment, justice, decree,\u201d and \u201cthat which has passed,\u201d and while qadr means \u201cmeasure, decree,\u201d it also means \u201cdestiny\u201d because it is according to a measure that things unfold and develop. The judgment, or the final destiny, of any created thing follows according to its measure, its qadr , for if it did not, there would be chaos. These measures may fluctuate and interweave within definite bounds, but there must be a measure in order for man to know the limits and to gain knowledge of the world. Laylat al-qadr is the Night of Power, or the Night of the Decree. The knowledge of what is written descended on the night of power and was made known to the Prophet Muhammad, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa salaam . Thus it is the night when he was empowered with knowledge, the night when the hidden tablet was unveiled to him. The night of qadr occurs according to each person\u2019s capacity. \u201cThe Night of the Decree\u201d is that night of revelation when the heart opens, when the tablet within man\u2019s heart is unveiled, when the direct recognition that there is only Allah, and that everything which comes into creation comes through that single power, is experienced. This tablet does not contain encyclopedic information: it contains direct knowledge. Eid The word Eid appears only once in the Qur\u2019an, in Surah Ma\u00b4idah . It is the story of the sincere followers of the Prophet Isa. They ask him: \"Can\u2019t you bring upon us from the unseen a banquet or a meal, or some nourishment? We want to taste of it so that our hearts become completely certain that all of it is from Allah.\" So Isa asks his Lord to bring down a heavenly banquet \u2013 an Eid , not only for those who came first but also for those of later time. We always quest the proof of the connection between the seen and the unseen, as our soul is heavenly but living on earth. This is the meaning of Eid . The Arabic root is aada , \u2018to have returned\u2019. Return to what? All of us, who have fasted, tend to return once more towards over indulgence. This is not an interesting return. What is worthwhile to return to is the original condition of Adam in the Garden. We need to move towards that Eid . \u1e62adr \u1e62adr (plural \u1e63ud\u016br) is the chest or breast, that part of one which faces what confronts one. It is where the battles and dramas take place. It must be remembered that every drama is self-created. Every imaginable human role stirs in the breast of man: the king, the despot, the afflicted, the jealous, the strong, the doubter, and the complainer. We have to take refuge from these, take refuge in the Lord Whose mercy brings us to the recognition that everything which occurs, visible and invisible, occurs according to a just system, according to perfect laws which govern this passage, this journey through the creation.","title":"Key Words"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#key-words","text":"","title":"Key Words"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#fitrah","text":"Fi\u1e6drah is the \"natural and basic disposition\" of humankind and is derived from fa\u1e6dara, to split or break apart, hence If\u1e6d\u0101r, \"breaking of the fast\".

The Saf\u012bh, the foolish, ignorant one whose life is cluttered and whose well is filled up with the debris of illusions, desires, attachments and covetousness, has no access to that original crack, that fi\u1e6drah.","title":"Fi\u1e6drah"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#ruh","text":"R\u016b\u1e25 means \u201cspirit, soul.\u201d It is related to r\u012b\u1e25 , which means \u201cwind.\u201d R\u0101\u1e25ah , which means \u201ccomfort, contentment, or ease,\u201d also comes from the same root, as does the word r\u0101\u2019i\u1e25ah , which means \u201cperfume\u201d and mirwa\u1e25ah , which means \u201cfan.\u201d The implication here is that the spirit is like a wind; it is as subtle as a summer breeze. The spirit is blown into the body and later blown out of it. Like the wind, its subtlety is balanced by its forcefulness. It says in the Qur\u2019an: \u201cThey ask you about the soul. Say: the soul is one of the commands of my Lord\u201d (17:85). On that Night of Power the All-Mighty, All-Powerful Lord extends His mercy of knowledge and opens up the skies, and the angelic powers and forces fulfill their merciful duty of bringing forth clearly the message and knowledge of taw\u1e25\u012bd and the command and control of the Lord.","title":"R\u016b\u1e25"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#sajdah","text":"Closeness to Allah is by sajdah, by prostration, which is the outer proof of inner abandonment. Outer prostration is the manifestation of an inner state; if it is not, it becomes an empty ritual. Sajada, the root of sajdah, also means \u201cto obey,\u201d meaning to obey the purpose of existence. The purpose of existence is merciful and benign. Another meaning of sajada is \u201cto submit,\u201d and through that submission comes freedom. The only freedom is the recognition of no freedom. The only freedom is the direct inner recognition that there is absolutely no possibility of freedom. From that comes the ultimate freedom and release which is the real and infinite freedom, freedom that is beyond our creation and after our end. Our purpose is to be in that state of inward drunkenness and outward sobriety, inward abandonment and outward courtesy and correctness. In this state we become awareness itself, not aware of something. This then is the outer manifestation of sajdah, of prostration, which is spontaneous. It is the only human position and it is the final as well as the first human position.","title":"Sajdah"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#fajr","text":"Fajr means \u201cdawn, the first light of the morning.\u201d Fajara, the root of fajr, means \u201cto crack, to break out, to explode.\u201d The state of the heart of the knower is hidden in the darkness of the night but is illumined inwardly. It is outwardly in darkness yet bright with inner light, outwardly quiet but inwardly active and dynamic in the sea of knowledge. Most spiritual work is done from late at night until the dawn, when outwardly there is the least physical action and therefore a maximum possibility for inner action. The root of everything lies in its opposite. The root of the most beautiful, soft, white, ravishing lily lies in mud just as the root of maximal inner action lies in outer quietude. From the knowledge that all creation exists according to a measure and is moving toward a destiny according to that measure, comes the peace of certainty. This inner certainty, which illumines all possible outer manifestations, brings about an equilibrium and balance that renders the awakened being in a state full of harmony and unity. The meaning of that peace, which is the result of knowledge, resides inherently in every heart. For the seed to be unearthed, the heart must be purified and made open. The seeker of the knowledge of Allah spends his days of darkness and nights of vigil awaiting the descent of the opening, and when that occurs it is like the crack of dawn.","title":"Fajr"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#dhikr","text":"The Arabic word for remembrance is dhikr . Remembrance is of several types or levels. There is the remembrance of physical things, which are in front of us, and there is the remembrance of one\u2019s desires, anxieties, and so on. Along the spiritual path, remembrance relates to that which is in one\u2019s innate nature. It is the remembrance of the Essence of Allah the Almighty, of the Source of all manifestations and attributes. That source is within everybody. On the Sufi path, one is required to dis-remember everything else that is discernible, everything that is other than Allah, in order to return to the original remembrance. The Arabic word for remembrance of Allah is dhikru\u2019llah. So the original remembrance of Allah is already in every heart, whether one is aware of it or not. Through the guidance of a spiritual master, the seeker is led beyond, to a level where there is no remembrance of anything that is mentionable. Then that which has always been there, encompassing everything, is eventually experienced and witnessed. The purpose of Sufi practices is to be spontaneously aware of the absolute or central reality as well as remaining aware of the physical and material limitations of the phenomenal world which surrounds us. One is an inner awareness beyond the senses and the other is an outer awareness which is based on senses.","title":"Dhikr"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#qadr-and-qada","text":"\"Certainly, We sent it down on the Night of the Decree.\" The Power that created all the creational systems made them according to a measure, the Decree or qadr , by which all creational manifestations are brought to their destiny, qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 , and final judgment. In the above ayat we are given a glimpse into an aspect of the meaning of qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 wa qadr (destiny and decree). Qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 means \u201cfate, destiny, judgment, justice, decree,\u201d and \u201cthat which has passed,\u201d and while qadr means \u201cmeasure, decree,\u201d it also means \u201cdestiny\u201d because it is according to a measure that things unfold and develop. The judgment, or the final destiny, of any created thing follows according to its measure, its qadr , for if it did not, there would be chaos. These measures may fluctuate and interweave within definite bounds, but there must be a measure in order for man to know the limits and to gain knowledge of the world. Laylat al-qadr is the Night of Power, or the Night of the Decree. The knowledge of what is written descended on the night of power and was made known to the Prophet Muhammad, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa salaam . Thus it is the night when he was empowered with knowledge, the night when the hidden tablet was unveiled to him. The night of qadr occurs according to each person\u2019s capacity. \u201cThe Night of the Decree\u201d is that night of revelation when the heart opens, when the tablet within man\u2019s heart is unveiled, when the direct recognition that there is only Allah, and that everything which comes into creation comes through that single power, is experienced. This tablet does not contain encyclopedic information: it contains direct knowledge.","title":"Qadr and Qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#eid","text":"The word Eid appears only once in the Qur\u2019an, in Surah Ma\u00b4idah .

We want to taste of it so that our hearts become completely certain that all of it is from Allah.\" So Isa asks his Lord to bring down a heavenly banquet \u2013 an Eid , not only for those who came first but also for those of later time. We always quest the proof of the connection between the seen and the unseen, as our soul is heavenly but living on earth. This is the meaning of Eid . The Arabic root is aada , \u2018to have returned\u2019. Return to what? All of us, who have fasted, tend to return once more towards over indulgence. This is not an interesting return. What is worthwhile to return to is the original condition of Adam in the Garden.

To live as a soul, the animal self needs to be held within bounds; and then to transcend sensory experiences to the abode of perfect Grace. The real you is ever present as your soul and to realise that and live it you need to transcend all and enter the zone of the soul's presence.","title":"Soul"},{"location":"pointers/spectrum/three-cs/","text":"Consciousness, Connectivity, and Continuity Every living creature is driven to connect with what is relevant for survival and continuity to experience life.

Note : We recommend that you read the article Less is More and reflect on it before you go through these descriptions. This article is an extract from the book \"Journey of the Self\" . The Four Journeys Another model of the journey of the self is given by the great Sufi master, Mulla Sadra. He uses the analogy of the wayfarer to describe any human's journey from the state of ignorant darkness to one of illuminated awareness. In this model he describes the four stages of unveilings along the journey. It begins when a human reaches a point where s/he realises there is no lasting fulfillment in the existential, changing world. We all experience at different times in our life the desire for tranquility and seclusion. When worldly difficulties and failures mount, we may wish to leave it all. Many of us go through a period when the monastic life seems an appropriate refuge and it is during these times that we want to turn our backs on creation. It is often at times of the greatest difficulty and confusion that we turn towards the path of discovery of the source in order to understand the position we have landed in. It is when the actors in the play begin to question the plot that we seek to know the author and ask for an explanation. When we reach this point and realise that there can be no lasting fulfillment in the existential, changing world, we take flight to the edge of the known, which is the unknown dimension. Here the first stage of unveiling begins. The four stages which follow illustrate the main stations that the successful wayfarer attains in his/her journey. Throughout life, s/he will continue to experience the entire spectrum of states to varying degress of intensity. What Mulla Sadra wishes to emphasise here is the established station that the wayfarer attains, rather than simply the passing, temporary state which s/he will continue to experience from time to time in life. Your soul reflects the sacred presence, yet your earthly side experiences life through change. The real you is eternal, but appears to change. The First Journey: From Creation to Creator The first barrier to cross, or the first unveiling, is from the creation to the Creator. The wayfarer flees from the confusing, physical and material universe of opposites to another dimension - the dependable, real and reassuring world of the unified field of reality. The silence within is the knock on the inner door. The unveiling of the first barrier involves tearing away veils both of darkness and light that exist between the seeker and the spiritual reality within. Then the ascent can begin from the station of the lower self to the station of the intellect, and from the station of the intellect to the the station of the spirit, and from the station of the spirit to the farthest goal of supreme splendour. If the wayfarer succeeds in reaching this goal, the final veils are lifted and s/he is annihilated by the death of the transitory, dissolved and submerged in the divine source. The Second Journey: With the Creator by the Courtesy of the Creator Our origin and essence is perpetual in its perfect beingness. The second unveiling is the journey across the barrier to knowledge of the Creator. The wayfarer is now exposed to Reality by the courtesy of Reality. S/he moves totally in the inner realm. S/he attains gnosis. His/her essence, attributes and actions become annihilated in the divine essence. In this journey, s/he sees through His seeing, hears through His hearing and knows through His knowing. When the inner journey and discoveries are taking place, the wayfarer looks for greater confirmation of these openings. S/he is like someone who discovers that s/he is truly a guest, and that the Host is most generous and understanding. The wayfarer then hopes for this condition to last and to remain in this refuge. As though s/he sees his/her image in a mirror for the first time. s/he seeks confirmation and establishment of what s/he has seen. The Third Journey: From the Creator to Creation by the Permission of the Creator The completion of the second unveiling marks the start of the third journey. In this, the wayfarer returns from the Creator back to creation by the permission of the Creator. In this journey, s/he is armed with the knowledge of truth. The wayfarer's state of self-annihilation is complete and s/he now attaines full sobriety and balance. S/he subsists through the subsistence of the Creator. S/he returns to creation by the authority of the Creator with the knowledge of the unveiling. The nature of life does not change and it carries on with its ups and downs. There is no avoidance by anyone of experiencing these outer waves which occur at the surface above the still depths of the ocean. So when the wayfarer is established in his station, s/he returns to creation with all its turmoil. However, the wayfarer, because of his/her knowledge of the nature of the ocean, is now far more able to deal with its changing surface. The waves are of little signficance and the storms are relative puffs of wind compared to the stable mass of the deep. The Fourth Journey: With Creation by the Authority of the Creator To go beyond mind, reason, and habits is the ultimate act of intelligence. The wayfarer then embarks upon the fourth stage, which is to be among creation by the authority of the Creator, when nothing else remains but service in the bliss of knowledge. the seeker observes and recognises creation and humanity, their behaviour and needs. S/he knows the good that they bring about and the evil that they cause, and what causes them happiness and what brings misery. In all this, s/he is with the truth, for his/her entire being has been submerged in reality, and the service rendered by him/her to other beings does not distract from the inner divine bliss, steadfastness and certainty. The fully realised being is now in the ultimate unitive state. S/he is completely in outer service of humanity and in inner abandonment, freedom and joy. When reality in all its various aspects is unveiled to the wayfarer and s/he is established in the knowledge of truth within, a new outlook towards creation emerges. The awakened being sees the divine thread through all existence and therefore is qualified to serve with selflessness, with no danger to creation or to themself. When the individual self has aligned itself with original unified reality, the flowering of the spiritual being has occurred. It is this unveiling that is referred to as \"with creation by the authority of the Creator.\" Wherever the enlightened being looks, he sees the trace and the mark of the Creator. S/he is now an agent of transformation, a loyal slave to the Divine Master and a freed being with no choice but to reflect what comes to his/her pure heart. This is the state of a prophet with the people - outwardly the same as any of them, inwardly turned to the eternal origin.

Energy and Awareness In any given situation you will have a certain amount of energy. However we like to measure it, you will find a certain amount of energy available at any one time. Why are most of us unbalanced or dissatisfied at the moment? It is because our energy is not harnessed. We are not contained and therefore not wholesome. Part of our energy is leaking away in the form of anxiety and worry. If a third of my energy is dwelling in the past, suffering from it or proud of it, and another third is concerned about the future \u2013 whether it is about the welfare of my children, my reputation, failure or success \u2013 then only a third remains. Therefore, only one third of me is really available to be drawn from now. The more you worry, the less likely you are to achieve the expected result, because some of your energy is dissipated in concern. And the body is absorbing some of it in the form of perspiration, heat or nervousness. These are all forms of dissipation. So where are you now if half of you is buried in the past and the other half is anxiously concerned about the future? What is left of you? Self-knowledge is about wholesomeness. It is in order to see totality inwardly, to see the absoluteness, to see the integratedness of everything, which is Oneness. Generosity Selflessness We enjoy ease and the smooth flow of life, welcoming generosity at all levels \u2014 material, mental and emotional. A generous act can be transactional or free of the expectation of any return. Even then, there is a subtle transaction \u2014 the giver also receives. All our actions are interactive and the dynamics of energy fields and matter are ceaseless. A generous mind is limited and measured, whereas a generous heart can be unconditional and simply flows. The ego self is the obstacle to such generosity and can darken the heart. Modesty reduces egoistic tendency and selfless acts touch hearts and souls. The human journey is from ego to soul. The ultimate human purpose is to recognize the ego\u2019s limitations and transcend it through generous acts and unconditional love. Passion A spiritual seeker may be initially motivated by the love of paradise and fear of hell fire. The awakened person is no longer concerned about either, due to being absorbed in the love of the ever present perfection. Then comes passion, in which the lover has lost direction and identification, being lost in the Beloved. In the outer world being lost is stupidity and ignorance, whereas in the inner world being lost to the essence is the entry into serendipity and bliss. With the realization of life\u2019s great potential, every moment becomes precious and is given its due respect and importance. To be deliberately enslaved to the supreme cosmic light is to be free from outer shadows. It is by God\u2019s generosity, mercy and grace that we turn away from our egotistical dark shadows towards the luminous light of the soul within the heart. Prophets, messengers and enlightened beings have awakened to these companions and guides along the spiritual path. These revealed knowledges cannot be reached by reason, wisdom or supplication. They need to be imbibed or absorbed through passion. Concern The less the self is concerned with worldly matters, the greater the soul\u2019s receptivity to messages and guidance via the heart. People who excel in the material world are unlikely to be able to give sufficient attention to the exploration of the inner subtler realms. Love, trust and absorption in the outer world may harden the heart and hinder spiritual progress. Worldly people are often given a chance to reflect upon meanings and higher purposes through failures and difficulties, but their persistent mental habits and egos block inner openings and a balanced life. When you concern yourself with what does not concern you, you will miss giving attention to what should concern you and is important for your evolvement. Two Zones There are always at least two viewpoints at any time. You can face the past or the future, origin or destination. You observe and hear what is outside of you or reflect upon your inner senses and feelings. You are always held in between these two zones and desire balance and stability. This tension enables us to grow and evolve physically, mentally and spiritually. Everything that exists has an outer and an inner facet, which are in balance. For a youngster, most experiences are due to sensory stimulation. For an adult there is outer and inner consciousness. For an awakened being the outer and inner are seamlessly bound together due to the emergence of the light of the Oneness. Discriminating between outer and inner is the first step to realizing their inseparability in essence.","title":"Self Knowledge and Presence"},{"location":"reflections/self-knowledge-presence/#self-knowledge-and-unfolding-into-presence","text":"The illusion of separation is a driving force toward the conclusion\u2014Universal Oneness, perpetual singularity.","title":"Self Knowledge and Unfolding Into Presence"},{"location":"reflections/self-knowledge-presence/#energy-and-awareness","text":"In any given situation you will have a certain amount of energy.

It is by God\u2019s generosity, mercy and grace that we turn away from our egotistical dark shadows towards the luminous light of the soul within the heart. Prophets, messengers and enlightened beings have awakened to these companions and guides along the spiritual path. These revealed knowledges cannot be reached by reason, wisdom or supplication. They need to be imbibed or absorbed through passion.","title":"Passion"},{"location":"reflections/self-knowledge-presence/#concern","text":"The less the self is concerned with worldly matters, the greater the soul\u2019s receptivity to messages and guidance via the heart. People who excel in the material world are unlikely to be able to give sufficient attention to the exploration of the inner subtler realms. Love, trust and absorption in the outer world may harden the heart and hinder spiritual progress. Worldly people are often given a chance to reflect upon meanings and higher purposes through failures and difficulties, but their persistent mental habits and egos block inner openings and a balanced life. When you concern yourself with what does not concern you, you will miss giving attention to what should concern you and is important for your evolvement.","title":"Concern"},{"location":"reflections/self-knowledge-presence/#two-zones","text":"There are always at least two viewpoints at any time. You can face the past or the future, origin or destination. You observe and hear what is outside of you or reflect upon your inner senses and feelings. You are always held in between these two zones and desire balance and stability. This tension enables us to grow and evolve physically, mentally and spiritually. Everything that exists has an outer and an inner facet, which are in balance. For a youngster, most experiences are due to sensory stimulation. For an adult there is outer and inner consciousness. For an awakened being the outer and inner are seamlessly bound together due to the emergence of the light of the Oneness. Discriminating between outer and inner is the first step to realizing their inseparability in essence.","title":"Two Zones"},{"location":"reflections/vice-virtue-appropriate-conduct/","text":"Virtuous Being and Higher Conduct Daily needs and rationality are healthy diversions from the intensity of Reality or Truth, for it is so powerful that we need diversions. We often experience disappointment and frustrations. We also too often feel trapped, confused or lost. Why are we constantly faced with these challenges? This is due to the limitations of conditioned consciousness and ego. Between birth and death, we play roles in this shadow theatre of life, as we evolve towards our origin. Frustrations arise out of the disparity between our higher soul consciousness and the shadow self. How can we refer and calibrate our perceived experience with the constancy of the soul? It is helpful to have a role model, and more helpful to have a trusted teacher who reflects higher consciousness. Virtues and Vices and the Importance of Interaction From the book \u201cThe Journey of the Self \u2013 A Sufi Guide to Personality\u201d . The importance of virtue to self-development can be seen after defining what is meant by virtue. We define virtue as behaviour occurring at the centre of two extremes, both of which are unvirtuous. The virtuous value which is at the centre is not affected by the unvirtuous values around it unless it moves towards one or the other extremes, away from the centre. When this happens, the virtue takes on the colour of that particular vice. For example, the virtue of generosity is the midpoint between two vices \u2013 meanness at one extreme, and indiscriminate giving, or wastefulness, at the other extreme. This characteristic of virtue (lying at the centre between vices), becomes practically useful once understood, practiced and perfected in actual life-transaction situations. Interacting and transacting with the extremes is an essential ingredient in acquiring the knowledge of virtues. Virtues are the outcome of dynamic and active situations involving interaction with other people and beings. In our social exchanges, we will both teach and be taught virtues. Necessarily, we will have to be patient with all the afflictions and setbacks we experience until we perfect our knowledge. Loyalty To be loyal implies total connection between understanding and unity \u2013 thus loyalty emanates from the field of Oneness. Can there be loyalty between two changing entities? Can you be loyal to another human being? Change, uncertainty and the fields of duality are barriers to loyalty. Unless there is one constant reference, loyalty cannot be durable! Unless each entity calibrates with its organic source of Oneness there can be no lasting loyalty. True loyalty to another being can emanate from the original loyalty to the One essence from which all dualities have emanated. Loyalty to the One can bring about the experience of being loyal to those seeking the knowledge and experience of the One. It is part of human nature to consider loyalty as a good virtue for it contains within it an aspect of Oneness and unity. The purpose of human life is to be in constant reference to the cosmic Oneness \u2013 Allah and all his attributes. Higher Consciousness Higher consciousness is our enduring nature and reality; and the closer we are to it the more we feel secure in its presence. The zone of higher consciousness is infinite and beyond all descriptions like joy, bliss or happiness. A good example of how to move to higher consciousness is riding a bicycle. You are put on the saddle and somebody pushes you. After a while you learn to balance and you feel you can repeat it on your own. Similarly, you first need a map of Reality, and you then follow the path that may lead to your destination. Determination and grace are required to awaken to your Soul. It is when you experience that ever-present Reality, you know that your old self was merely a shadow of the Real. When you transcend your tyrannical or feral self, you perceive that its role was to cause suffering and thereby act as a prelude for awakening. Your lower self leads you to your real Self \u2013 the Divine Spirit within. Life on earth is a struggle because it is a realm of experience between limitations and limitless Reality. You need help and a guiding hand. You need a reference. You need Grace and perception of the Sacred Presence. Now Is Eternal Identity relates to mind, memory and time. Thoughts connect the past to the present and future. Reflection, meditation and the silent mind enable us to experience the immense present moment \u2013 now. Much human effort is expended to reduce distance and separation. As for time, we are constantly trying to move faster, to fit more in. It is more effective to stop time altogether. Suffering conditioned consciousness drives us towards stillness in mind, which opens the door of timelessness and perpetual presence. All human endeavours lead to that point of experience, which occurs when the mind is content and still. The moment of success or heightened pleasure reflects this state. Within the still moment lies the zone of transcendence of mind and time. That is the infinitude of Reality. When the past is lost and the future is of no concern, the perfection of now is a great gift that yields a lasting thrill.","title":"Vices, Virtues and Appropriate Conduct"},{"location":"reflections/vice-virtue-appropriate-conduct/#virtuous-being-and-higher-conduct","text":"Daily needs and rationality are healthy diversions from the intensity of Reality or Truth, for it is so powerful that we need diversions.

It is what it is. Endless, boundless, with constant connection between what begins and what ends. Both at the same time and in no time. In no time and on time! Time is a fiction that paints all of these amazing tableaus. Most of them are dynamic, in constant interchange, and self-organising within the so-called frame of space. That\u2019s what it is. It is the gift of gifts. It is a treasure beyond any measure. We have it, but you have to lose everything else in order for you to really have it, or know. Better even than that, we can say that it has you. You don\u2019t have it! You don\u2019t have life; life has you. Life controls you, because once it has touched you, then it is a sacred touch. You either go mad, or you become awakened to the full Being who is dancing the tune of infinite harmonic flow. That\u2019s why nothing will ever be enough, for anyone. Once you know that, then it is enough! Contentment will only come after not only realising, not only awakening to it, but being fully embedded in it, otherwise it won\u2019t happen. Nothing will be enough, ever. That is why we have unleashed this dark energy globally, epitomised by phrases like \u201cThe sky is the limit!\u201d There is a lot of black wisdom around - what does a phrase like this really mean? What does the sky have to do with me and my limitations? There is a lot of this sort of stupidity enveloping the whole world. It appears very sound, very exciting, very interesting. It is rubbish. Most of what we hear, most so-called common wisdom, is a lot of rubbish. What is it that I am after? It is to be at one with my source and origin, which is the same as my destiny, because it is timeless. That is what I am after: the certainty that what I have identified with - the so-called \u201cme\u201d - is based on an essence, or reality, or light that is eternal. If it is eternal, then I am content and I can function. Otherwise, I am not reliable. In essence, all \u2018other\u2019 human beings are the same as you. This is the story: each one of us is potentially the same. But the way it twists and turns and returns to its origin is different. There is differentiated sameness: it is the same in its totality, origin and destiny, but different in the way it appears. It appears as a different human being with a different shape, different size, different thing occupying their mind and so on. But the story is the same: he wants what I want what she wants, which is constant calibration with the moment. That brings about an ongoing contentment, so it becomes your nature. Three Keys The natural desire to change the world is a reflection of the need of self to yield and be transformed to soul. This outcome is greater than changing the world. At the moment your nature is very challenging, because one minute you are content, the next you are not. One minute I feel he is a friend, the next I think he is a foe. One second I am breathing in, the next I am breathing out. We are hanging on millions of different fields of energy which are all based on duality. My anchor, or my stability, or my calibration is Unity; but it must be done, not discussed. Therefore, there are three things which, if you bear them in mind, you will manage to live a reasonable life. One and two are for every one of us: no one is spared. First and foremost, we must - at all times - trust that there is perfect governance. Boundless governance, which governs everything from the tiny insect to the plants, the trees, the galaxies, the supernovae and so on forever. I can only benefit from that trust if I am truly honest, which is the second one. Honesty about who you are, which is not only the outer role or manifestation implied by your ID. Complete honesty about this question takes you to the point of knowing that you are a celestial light undertaking a terrestrial journey. That\u2019s honesty. Then you have no option other than trust, because you are tranquil. Otherwise you are, like everybody else, in miserable agitation and mental illness. Mental illness will double or triple over the next fifty years. Mental disturbance is going to be the theme, because we have not recalibrated with the fact that I am all of these and none of these and I trust in this moment, through which everything emanates and to which everything returns. All that there is is the moment! And the moment is eternal. The natural outcome of knowledge and guidance is the experience of sacred presence and its perfection. Both of these two things are based on the third, which is to do your best . You have to be engaged. So long as you are caught in this frame of space and time, you have to be involved with something. If you don\u2019t do it, you are actually worse than dead. You must be outwardly involved: give and take. You are involved by breathing! Why don\u2019t you stop that? Eating, sleeping, connecting, relating: you can\u2019t be safe. There is no safety! You have to jump into it and hope for the best, having these two things in mind. Be totally honest. Say, \u201cI do like this\u201d, or \u201cI don\u2019t like that\u201d. Be honest about it!

Within conditioned consciousness we question, reflect, share, and try to discover what the original cause is. Once we are at the point of neutrality, then the light of inner perception beams from the soul, reflecting the Origin. The question is replaced with a taste of Reality and the experience of Oneness \u2013 a glorious answer which ends all questions. Your personal entity is now in inseparable connection with Cosmic Reality. Any practice connects the intention hidden within the mind with an outer action which aims towards some sort of conclusion, realisation or outcome. Most of your regret and suffering is due to the disharmony between the deep, inner state of your heart and your short-lived frustration, fear, or impatience. If your action stems from a seamless connection between a higher intention and your honest assessment of your ability to act properly \u2013 if there is harmony between these two zones \u2013 then you are in the flow of space and time in a healthy way. Correct practice relates to so many different aspects of the human being and his or her state. You can\u2019t deny the physical, chemical and material connections which make up your self \u2013 from organs, to cells, to the billions of neurons constantly firing the pattern of \u2018you\u2019. There is a complete orchestration which produces the usual description of who you are. We are largely unaware of all these processes. Most of them are autonomous, though they respond to each other and to various external factors, as well as to the ultimate governing force, which is your own soul. Appropriate and correct action is that which improves your state and the overall state from which you have emerged. Appropriate action is that which leaves any situation you experience better than it was before. There are two issues which we always need to bear in mind: Evolution connects us all. From a very simple cell in which the experience of life was unimaginably limited to what we human beings now experience of life in its magnificent, total and boundless way. The rise in consciousness always continues. The consciousness of the average human being nowadays is considerably higher, broader and deeper than the average human being a thousand years ago. These two factors are vital to bear in mind. They point to the reason for the cycles in existence: it began with a \u201cbig bang\u201d and it will end with a big collapse. In the meantime, there are countless numbers of souls or spirits which have the potential to awaken to the origin of the cosmic Reality and how it takes place. This is the whole story. Why We are here to practice and experience the ever present unifying field between diverse realities. The absolute is ever present and permanent Reality is the Absolute itself. Our rise in knowledge and consciousness occurs through leaving behind what we already know is temporary and unreliable. Suffering, fear and sadness serve as warnings and reminders that we have fallen into the trap of belief and trust in a state whose nature is changeable. What To Do We all pursue and desire contentment and the happy moment without fears, sorrow and insecurity, which are all characteristic of temporary and conditioned consciousness. To experience the eternal moment, you must do your utmost in the present with constant reference to absolute truth. Practice silent resonance with timelessness, in total acceptance that the darkness of your temporary state is only understood due to the light of the permanent soul within. The idea of free will is part of the mystery of the imaginal which gives you the illusion of a separate identity from Absolute Reality. Whatever there is in the universe follows a determined pattern, but you may exercise your intelligence to return to and maintain the clarity of mind and purity of heart required to avoid undesirable outcomes. Our consciousness has evolved over millennia. As humans, we can realise and accept that each one of us seeks contentment and happiness, which is a necessary state for the rise in consciousness towards the Absolute.

The beginner\u2019s mind is fresh, flexible, and close to the door of eternal presence and the infinite Nowness. Further information on this section can be found in the book Spectrum of Reality . Emptying Out The purpose of your being here is to recognise the knowledge that is already rooted within you.

As the people of gnosis say, \u201cFirst we must empty ourselves.\u201d And how do we do this except by recognizing that cheating one another is of no use and that hoarding is of no use? By experience we learn that these things are not going to make us happier. The reason why we want money is to have the potential of freeing ourselves from future desires. So then why have future desires? It is so simple. Once we learn this then emptying out becomes sweet.

Human life is a process of learning through acceptance and rejection. To activate and access your heart, you need to reduce outer worldly concerns. To understand fully the greatness, power and perfection of the present moment, you need to cleanse the mind from its past or future fears. Only then can you live now.

Throughout all world religions and spiritual systems various practices are prescribed to move us from basic conditioned consciousness into the vastness of soul consciousness, or boundless consciousness. The art of stillness is at the heart of all these practices and endeavours. Stillness is the portal back to your origin, which is peace. Non-differentiation is your origin and it is also in your heart, soul or spirit. The essence and the origin of all is total, cosmic non-differentiation. We emerge from that and to it we return. In that zone, there is no higher or lower or better or worse: there just is. According to modern science, this is the state which we now consider to be a perfect vacuum. However, we also know that there is no such thing as absolute emptiness. There are millions of interactions that are unseen \u2013 what scientists now call \u201cemergence and submergence\u201d or \u201ccreation and destruction\u201d. As they burst into existence, matter and antimatter meet and annihilate. All of life emanates from this \u2013 universes turning into existence and non-existence within the multiverse. The whole cosmic story is truly a divine drama. The infinite unseen becomes the finite seen. So, when you refer back to silence, you are at the door of that infinite unseen. You have stopped the clutter, the distraction of noise, action and movement, which can only occur in space and time. Your origin and mine \u2013 the soul or spirit \u2013 is not in space and time. It is acting in space and time, it is apparently living in space and time, but its origin is not in space and time. It is infinite and boundless: that is why it is sacred. This is why we have to revere it truly. The more often we refer to the point of total stillness and silence, the more we will come to realise that this point is none other than the sanctum of divinity. Although the entire story is under divine management, we can still act in small ways, either seamlessly aligned with our origin, or following the seeming desires of an empty self-image. If you want to undertake a real pilgrimage, go into total silence and \u2018lose\u2019 everything. There is nothing that is reliable or durable. That which is reliable and durable cannot be described or defined: it is a cosmic light that is in every heart. You are not who you think you are.","title":"Stillness"},{"location":"reflections/practice/transformative-worship/","text":"Transformative Worship To believe that God governs all is a big relief from the fear and concerns about injustice and other wrongdoings that we cannot help. Islam addresses our material, mental and spiritual needs at all levels - personal or communal. The path of acceptance is based on the fundamental realization that truth, higher consciousness, or the 'Absolute' permeates all universes and realities, seen and unseen. Through submission, we come to realize that the direction of the life-force in human beings is towards experiencing the mysterious grace of Sacred Presence. If there is a purpose in life it is to know that life is eternal and intrinisically utterly perfect , irrespective of short term human perception. The prophetic revelations emphasize the need for human beings to accept responsibility for their intentions and actions and to willfully desire higher levels of consciousness and insight, i.e. knowledge of God. All acts of worship and religious pointers are intended to reduce the veils and background noise in the human psyche or ego, so that the innate light within the heart (soul) shines and elevates the individual to God consciousness without denial of earthly limitations. He \"is closer to you than your jugular vein,\" - 50:16 \"Wherever you turn, there is the face of Allah.\" - 2:115 The ultimate challenge in life is to realize this spiritual fact. Real personal development of this knowledge relates directly to sincerity, trust and certainty. The result is conscious awareness of Allah at all times and in all circumstances. This God consciousness is referred to as taqwa in Islam, which puts an emphasis on attaining it through dhikr : remembrance and awareness of this primary and ultimate light within us, the source of self-awareness. Being in constant reference to this Supreme Consciousness enables us to put into perspective all other changing states that we experience in life. The Two Spheres Human consciousness has two levels or spheres of awareness: The personal, local or conditioned consciousness The boundless, pure consciousness that enables us to go beyond the limitations of local awareness. The 'fall' of Adam from paradise can be regarded as the force that propels his offspring to seek eternal perfection through higher consciousness. The Qur'an's description of human life as a gift, or 'loaned trust' implies a pure consciousness that is boundless and eternal, a sacred relization or presence. Muslims often refer to this sacred tradition ( hadith qudsi ) of the Prophet (pbuh): The shari`ah is my words, tariqah my actions, and haqiqah my state. Understanding is my capital, reason the basis of my way of life, and love my foundation; longing is my mount, fear my companion, and knowledge my weapon; forbearance is my master, trust in Allah my helper, and contentment my treasure; truthfulness is my stopping place, certainty my shelter, poverty my pride, and by it I am honoured over all Prophets and Messengers. Experiencing Perfection Human beings are driven to higher consciousness by prayer, meditation and a host of creative pursuits such as the arts, music and other transcendental activities, all of which reflect our yearning to return to a blissful state of contented happiness - paradise. It is ultimately supreme consciousness that we all desire, here and now. All acts of worship begin with self-awareness and a desire for higher knowledge. The preparation for worship is the declaration of intent and the hope to be focussed, attentive and engaged in the process of deepening one's state of awareness. A point may arrive when the worshiper loses concerns with worldly mundane matters and begins to experience subtler levels of awareness which are deeper than the normal day to day variety. The ultimate purpose of worship and prayer is to realize experientially a state that is not subject to earthly or mental limitations. This may be variously identified as the sacred void, inner bliss, pure peace, or ultimate or higher consciousness. Unity Islam is founded upon experiencing unity. The whole universe has emanated from one source and appears in infinite levels and layers of dualities, diversities, complementarities, competitions, cooperation and other forces. All these dualities reflect an aspect of a higher attribute which includes the names of Allah. With spiritual progress we realize that all actions emanate from the essential source of all energies - Allah.

Mindfulness Mindfulness which is groomed, developed and fully evolved will lead to mindlessness and heart-fullness.

As personal human consciousness evolves soul consciousness provides the stable background behind the changes, for the soul is linked to the non-space-time dimension. When consciousness is unified, perfection is witnessed at all times. When the body is well and relaxed and the mind is still, a moment of joyfulness may be experienced spontaneously without any discernible reason. In such a state, time seems to have stopped or to be moving smoothly. Concern for the future and sorrows from the past are forgotten. When the heart is content, the self expresses a moment of perfect harmony and peace. At such an instant personal consciousness is in unison with soul consciousness and the self experiences harmony and a glow of well-being. To witness perfection, all levels of consciousness need to relate smoothly and harmoniously. If happiness and contentment is the main purpose in life, then entry is through the door of experiencing and witnessing inner perfections. The human desire for outer success and excellence is only an aspect of aiming to realize the perfect moment. We sometimes succeed in worldly activity and at other times we fail. Pleasure through success is simply reflecting the experience of momentary outer unity and harmony. Even with failure, the events themselves have followed a perfect pattern of cause and effect, irrespective of the final result. There is, however, a danger that the spiritual seeker may develop a cynical or careless attitude towards outcomes. When someone expresses a lack of worldly interest and claims that outer success does not really matter, the heart may still harbor a secret desire or fear in that direction. There is a big difference between hoping for something and acting towards that end, and not hoping or acting, yet having a hidden desire. Witnessing perfections at all times implies seeing the outer and inner worlds with the soul\u2019s lens, not with the mind or self.

Everything in creation reflects, to a certain extent, an aspect of the numerous qualities of god. Every color of the rainbow is produced by the original colorless light.

Book Description Transformative Worship in Islam \u2013 Experiencing Perfection uniquely bridges the traditional practices and beliefs, culture and language of Islam with the transformative spiritual states described by the Sufis and Gnostics. In this collection of teachings on how the worship of Islam can transform insight and perception of Reality, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri presents profound guidance for those who journey through the path of Islamic belief and practice. He draws from the Noble Qur\u2019an, the Prophet\u2019s traditions, narrations from the Ahl al-Bayt and seminal works from Sufi masters and scholars. Transformative Worship in Islam \u2013 Experiencing Perfection will inspire the serious seeker of spiritual knowledge to make the connections between intention, attention and direction. Describing in detail the stages of spiritual evolvement, the author highlights the need for grooming the self, refining its lower tendencies, practicing self-accountability, and guiding it towards the higher virtues of the soul, through the regular discipline of a worship which brings one into Divine Presence. The seeker will be taken to the stages of self-realization where all dualities meet and unify within the human soul. The purified heart is a precondition for this awakening, while enlightenment is the natural outcome after dispelling all causes of egotistic confusion and concern for personal survival. This book reveals how the soul is forever embedded in sustainable joy and contentment and awakening to this condition is not only our birth-right but the very purpose of our existence. Fasting (sawm) Human interest in fasting is deeply rooted in our consciousness. Fasting has long been resorted to for maintaining physical and mental health as much as for cultural or political reasons. More specifically, fasting has been a devotional practice in most religious and spiritual movements throughout the ages. Islam has prescribed the practice of abstinence and fasting as a means of self-purification and worship. The act of restraining the self from fulfilling its desires purifies and enhances awareness at physical, mental and spiritual levels and sensitizes human consciousness. The seeker realizes the weakness of the self and is gratified by the discipline, restriction and prohibitions, for these limitations are windows to Allah\u2019s limitlessness. Fasting in History In many cultures, such as the Indians of North America, tribes of Brazil, the people of the Pacific Islands and numerous Asian, African and European peoples, fasting has been used as a rite of initiation, marking puberty, prior to hunting and as part of the rites of marriage. In some cultures, such as those in the Andaman Islands, Fiji, Samoa, China, Korea and others fasting is observed as a rite of mourning. In general, we find whenever human beings are in need, suppressed, or in fear, they seek God or higher powers through abstinence or penance. When our limited state of knowledge and consciousness is insufficient fasting guides us out of difficulties to find other means of inspiration and solutions. Ancient Egyptians, Greek, Roman, and Chinese cultures practiced fasting to cure various illnesses. The Egyptians believed that fasting three days a month helped to preserve good mental and physical health. The Greeks learned the virtues of fasting from the Egyptians and fasted before battle and the Romans followed suit. Socrates and Plato are known to have regularly performed fasts of ten days duration. Today in the West, fasting is used by alternative and naturopathic systems of medicine and healing for curing a host of acute and chronic diseases and as a useful catalyst in helping the body mobilize its own natural immune system. The Old Testament often refers to fasting: David chastened his soul with fasting, while Moses fasted for forty days when he ascended the mount to receive the tablets of the covenant. Daniel fasted for three weeks, supplicating and praying all the while. Jews observe six obligatory fasts during the year, one such being Yom Kippur. The institution of fasting and abstinence from certain foods in Christianity has its origin in the New Testament as it relates to the fasting of Jesus\u2019 disciples for several days during Lent, the forty-day period before Easter. The duration of the fast during Lent varied throughout the ages, until forty days accompanied by strict rules became the norm. Additional fasts were introduced later in different parts of the Church, such as the fast of Rogation Days, the Ember Weeks, the Whitsun Week, and fasts were also ordained by the Roman Catholic Church. Considerable variations in the practice of fasting are noticed between the Orthodox Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Reformed Churches of Europe. Over time there has been a gradual mitigation in the frequency and rigor of the fasts and abstinences prescribed by Church laws due to extenuating circumstances such as age, health, poverty, hard or continued labor and changing social conditions. Today few are obliged to fast strictly, while some are excused even from abstinence. Roman Catholic legislation further provides for dispensations to be granted by the Church authorities. The overall result is that the practice of fasting has declined and is almost forgotten as a religious exercise. During the twentieth century fasting has sometimes been used as a tool of political and social protest by individuals as well as groups. During the national struggles for independence from colonial rule, several leaders of the third world in Asia and Africa resorted to fasting to highlight their plight and struggle, often with some success. The Islamic Fast For Muslims fasting, or sawm in Arabic, was commanded in the Qur\u2019an as a major obligatory spiritual discipline for the duration of the month of Ramadan. The Arabic word for fasting is derived from the root, sama , meaning to abstain from food, drink, smoking, sensual gratifications, wrong actions, harmful intentions, thoughts, words and deeds. Islamic fasting is obligatory for one month in every lunar year, that is, Ramadan, the ninth month in the Islamic calendar. All healthy adults are expected to adhere to the proper rules of fasting. In addition to this obligatory fast, there are many optional fasts, some of which occur regularly every week or month, and some that are scattered throughout the year. These fasts are Sunnah, or the practice of the Prophet. Fasting is also used as a penance for breaking an oath and as a compensation for some other religious obligation. The fast of Ramadan begins with the physical sighting of the new moon. Throughout the month a Muslim may not eat or drink from daybreak (when a fine strip of light may be seen on the horizon) until the sun has set. Before dawn a small meal ( suhur ) is usually recommended to be taken, although not obligatory, and the fast is broken just before the sunset ( maghrib ) prayer traditionally with dates and water, to be immediately followed by the prayer. Later on a larger meal is partaken by the entire family, often shared with relatives, friends and guests. The daily fast is begun by formulating the intention to perform the fast as a rite by making a clear intention ( niyyah ) to observe the fast. No one should fast if their health cannot sustain it or if a fast should threaten one\u2019s health. Pregnant and nursing women whose health may be harmed are exempted, as are those who are travelling away from home. When health is restored or other conditions for not fasting are removed (such as menstruation) then the person is expected to make up the fast later during the course of the year. Ramadan offers the believer an opportunity to mark an end to daily indulgences, or at least to impose clear limits on a daily basis for the duration of a month. This daily restraint breaks the habitual patterns of the self and constitutes a purification both of body and spirit, which brings about renewal of strength and greater spiritual awareness. Each and every ritualistic practice of Islam disciplines the individual and strengthens Muslim society if applied thoroughly. Every year the month of Ramadan falls at different times because the lunar calendar is shorter than the solar by approximately ten days. This means that as the period of the fast is brought forward annually, Ramadan will fall during all seasons of the year in a gradual progression. Despite the strict rules and restraint induced by the fast, Ramadan is usually a joyful time for Muslims everywhere. The last ten nights of the month, particularly the odd nights, are the spiritual highlights of Ramadan, for one of these nights is Laylat al-Qadr , the Night of Determination, in which the Qur\u2019an was first revealed to the Prophet. During these nights Muslims spend their nights in supplication and prayer, hoping to favorably influence the course of events that will unfold subsequently. Ramadan comes to a close with the celebrations and prayers of Eid al-Fitr . On this day a Muslim will give appropriate alms to the poor, and families gather for a light morning repast after the congregational prayer. The Eid prayer, usually performed outdoors is accompanied by a discourse delivered by the prayer leader after which people exchange good wishes and celebrate their success in performing a most important act of worship and attaining a heightened awareness and purposefulness in life. The Prophet of Allah said: The root of Islam is prayer, its branches are the obligatory tax, its height is the fast, and its expanse is striving in the way of Allah. He also said: The tax of the body is fasting. A Jew who was one of the most learned of his people asked the Messenger of Allah: \u2018Why did Allah make it obligatory upon your people to fast throughout the day for thirty days?\u2019 The Prophet replied: When Adam ate from the tree it remained within his stomach for thirty days, so Allah made it obligatory upon his offspring to experience thirty days of hunger and thirst. Whatever they eat at night is a grace from Allah. Thus, it was with Adam, so Allah made the same obligatory for my people. Then he recited the verse: The fast is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you. 2:183 Imam al-Rida wrote the following concerning the obligation to fast: \"It is so that one may know the feeling of hunger and thirst, so that he will be humble and helpless, in order to be an indication of the difficulties of the Hereafter. Within it is contained the breaking of desires so that one will experience the deprivations caused by withholding from the poor and the needy.\" Imam al-Sadiq relates that the Prophet said: \"The fast is a shield, that is, a veil protecting one from the afflictions of the world and from the punishment of the Hereafter. Thus, when you fast, make the intention to restrain your self from its desires and cut off the thoughts inspired by Shaytan. Bring yourself to the place where you are content without the desire for food or drink.\"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"reflections/practice/fasting/#book-description","text":"Transformative Worship in Islam \u2013 Experiencing Perfection uniquely bridges the traditional practices and beliefs, culture and language of Islam with the transformative spiritual states described by the Sufis and Gnostics.

Islamic fasting is obligatory for one month in every lunar year, that is, Ramadan, the ninth month in the Islamic calendar. All healthy adults are expected to adhere to the proper rules of fasting. In addition to this obligatory fast, there are many optional fasts, some of which occur regularly every week or month, and some that are scattered throughout the year. These fasts are Sunnah, or the practice of the Prophet. Fasting is also used as a penance for breaking an oath and as a compensation for some other religious obligation. The fast of Ramadan begins with the physical sighting of the new moon. Throughout the month a Muslim may not eat or drink from daybreak (when a fine strip of light may be seen on the horizon) until the sun has set. Before dawn a small meal ( suhur ) is usually recommended to be taken, although not obligatory, and the fast is broken just before the sunset ( maghrib ) prayer traditionally with dates and water, to be immediately followed by the prayer. Later on a larger meal is partaken by the entire family, often shared with relatives, friends and guests. The daily fast is begun by formulating the intention to perform the fast as a rite by making a clear intention ( niyyah ) to observe the fast. No one should fast if their health cannot sustain it or if a fast should threaten one\u2019s health. Pregnant and nursing women whose health may be harmed are exempted, as are those who are travelling away from home. When health is restored or other conditions for not fasting are removed (such as menstruation) then the person is expected to make up the fast later during the course of the year. Ramadan offers the believer an opportunity to mark an end to daily indulgences, or at least to impose clear limits on a daily basis for the duration of a month. This daily restraint breaks the habitual patterns of the self and constitutes a purification both of body and spirit, which brings about renewal of strength and greater spiritual awareness. Each and every ritualistic practice of Islam disciplines the individual and strengthens Muslim society if applied thoroughly. Every year the month of Ramadan falls at different times because the lunar calendar is shorter than the solar by approximately ten days. This means that as the period of the fast is brought forward annually, Ramadan will fall during all seasons of the year in a gradual progression. Despite the strict rules and restraint induced by the fast, Ramadan is usually a joyful time for Muslims everywhere. The last ten nights of the month, particularly the odd nights, are the spiritual highlights of Ramadan, for one of these nights is Laylat al-Qadr , the Night of Determination, in which the Qur\u2019an was first revealed to the Prophet. During these nights Muslims spend their nights in supplication and prayer, hoping to favorably influence the course of events that will unfold subsequently. Ramadan comes to a close with the celebrations and prayers of Eid al-Fitr . On this day a Muslim will give appropriate alms to the poor, and families gather for a light morning repast after the congregational prayer. The Eid prayer, usually performed outdoors is accompanied by a discourse delivered by the prayer leader after which people exchange good wishes and celebrate their success in performing a most important act of worship and attaining a heightened awareness and purposefulness in life. The Prophet of Allah said: The root of Islam is prayer, its branches are the obligatory tax, its height is the fast, and its expanse is striving in the way of Allah. He also said: The tax of the body is fasting. A Jew who was one of the most learned of his people asked the Messenger of Allah: \u2018Why did Allah make it obligatory upon your people to fast throughout the day for thirty days?\u2019 The Prophet replied: When Adam ate from the tree it remained within his stomach for thirty days, so Allah made it obligatory upon his offspring to experience thirty days of hunger and thirst. Whatever they eat at night is a grace from Allah. Thus, it was with Adam, so Allah made the same obligatory for my people. Then he recited the verse: The fast is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you. 2:183 Imam al-Rida wrote the following concerning the obligation to fast: \"It is so that one may know the feeling of hunger and thirst, so that he will be humble and helpless, in order to be an indication of the difficulties of the Hereafter. Within it is contained the breaking of desires so that one will experience the deprivations caused by withholding from the poor and the needy.\" Imam al-Sadiq relates that the Prophet said: \"The fast is a shield, that is, a veil protecting one from the afflictions of the world and from the punishment of the Hereafter. Thus, when you fast, make the intention to restrain your self from its desires and cut off the thoughts inspired by Shaytan. Bring yourself to the place where you are content without the desire for food or drink.\"","title":"The Islamic Fast"},{"location":"reflections/practice/fasting/part-2/","text":"Excerpts from Shaykh Fadhlalla's book Transformative Worship in Islam: Experiencing Perfection . The purpose of the fast is to deaden the desires of the self; it is a cleansing for the heart and the body and a revival of both the inner and the outer. It also includes the expression of gratitude by those who stand in need before Allah for the grace and goodness bestowed. It increases humility, meekness, and tears, and causes one to seek refuge with Allah. The reason food is permitted during the night is because Allah does not make one responsible for more than one can endure. Allah has made it easy for us, which is the main characteristic of the shari`ah . Previously it has been said that Adam performed his fast in the daytime, that his repentance ( tawbah ) was accepted at the time of the afternoon prayer, and that he was freed of transgression at the time of the sunset prayer. This tradition is observed every day during one month so that during this time one may rid oneself of wrong actions and then be joyous in one\u2019s liberation from them by eating after sunset. The degrees of fasting can be arranged in the following manner: The first and lowest of them is that the person fasting limits himself to refraining from those things which would render his fast null and void but not from doing those things which are considered reprehensible. This is the fast of the general masses. The second is to restrain the body from whatever is considered reprehensible. Consequently, one guards his tongue against slander, his eyes against desire, and so on with the rest of his body. This represents the fast of the people of tariqah . The third, in addition to the above, is to protect the heart from going astray and from the whisperings of Shaytan, limiting it to the Remembrance of Allah and the witnessing of Him in all His manifestations. This represents the fast of the Chosen Few and is perfection itself. Meaning and Benefits of Fasting The fast is to refrain from specific things during certain specified intervals of time. Among its stipulations is the soundness of the intention covering a specific time period, for example, the month of Ramadan, or for the purpose of fulfilling an oath ( nadhar ). The intention which specifies the type of fast must also be made at the time when it is begun. Making Up or Expiation There are various categories of fasts and each has its particular regulations: obligatory fasts, recommended fasts, fasts for specific oaths, and fasts for non-specific oaths. Those actions which require a fast to be made up ( qada\u2019 ) or expiated ( kaff\u0101rah ) are nine in number and are as follows (as per the teachings of Ahl ul-Bayt ): Eating. Drinking. Sexual intercourse. Intentional ejaculation. Intentionally telling a lie concerning Allah, His Messenger, or the Imams. Complete submersion in water. Intentionally taking in thick dust in the throat (e.g. flour or anything similar). Intentionally remaining in a state of jan\u0101bah (ritual impurity) until after fajr . Going back to sleep after having already awakened before fajr . The kaff\u0101rah or expiation consists of fasting for two consecutive months, or feeding sixty people in need, or freeing a slave (this ruling remains even though slavery is no longer practiced, while the more likely practice will be the two former). One may choose one of the above. There are eight actions which will break the fast and will require the Muslim to make up a fast ( qad\u0101\u2019 ) without expiation: Eating, drinking, or engaging in sexual intercourse before confirming whether or not it is actually sunrise. Not accepting it when someone (reliable) says that it is sunrise. Following someone else who says that it is not yet sunrise when one is able to observe it oneself that it is indeed already sunrise. Following someone else who says it is night when one is able to ascertain it oneself. Breaking the fast ( ift\u0101r ) before its time has arrived; e.g. when in the presence of some obstruction (such as clouds) in the sky which makes it appear to be dark, and then it becomes clear that it is not yet the time of ift\u0101r . Returning to sleep after having already awakened once before taking a ritual bath from jan\u0101bah and not awakening again until after the sun has risen. Water entering the throat for those seeking to cool themselves (but this does not include the rinsing of the mouth in preparation for prayer). Finally, taking an enema. For the more mature Muslim, fasting means to abstain from anything which would be displeasing to their Lord and contrary to His commandment and prohibition, either in word or deed. The Messenger of Allah said: Everything has a door and the door to acts of devotion is fasting. The more advanced seeker abstains from whatever is forbidden and restrains the self. Fasting is a deep link between the seeker and his Lord which no one observes but Allah, in contrast to prayer, the obligatory tax, and the various other actions which are possible for others to notice (and therefore possibly motivated by the desire for acclaim or out of pride). Whoever wants to meet his Lord, then let him perform good actions and not see anything other than Allah in the worship of his Lord. [18:110] Seeing other than Allah ( shirk ) in this context refers to performing an act of worship for the eyes of someone other than Allah. The Prophet said: The infiltration of shirk within my people is more hidden than the creeping of a black ant on a black stone on a dark night. Islamic scholars say that this type of shirk refers to the performance of an act of worship for one\u2019s own reputation of piety or other worldly position. The men of inner knowledge say that it means \u2018to see anything other than the One\u2019, as Imam `Ali has said: The lowest form of riy\u0101\u2019 (worship performed to be seen by other than Allah) is shirk . There is no question of riy\u0101\u2019 if one sees no one but Allah. Open or hidden shirk will inevitably be weakened by cutting back desires and appetites, as Imam `Ali said: Shaytan flows through man like blood so constrict his passageways by hunger. The Messenger of Allah said: The gates of the garden are opened when Ramadan begins and the gates of the Fire are closed.","title":"Part 2"},{"location":"reflections/practice/fasting/part-2/#meaning-and-benefits-of-fasting","text":"The fast is to refrain from specific things during certain specified intervals of time.

Outward abstentions 1. Abstention of the Tongue This concerns useless, foolish, or discourteous speech, as well as anything which would be contrary to what pleases Allah. The Prophet said: Whoever is silent is saved. When the discussion reaches Allah, then be silent. Whoever knows his Lord, his tongue becomes still. That is to say, one is incapable of speaking about the absolute Source and Essence. Divine knowledge is to be tasted and witnessed personally and the tongue is incapable of expressing what is beyond the senses and the mind. The Messenger of Allah said: Whoever speaks too much speaks frivolously. Whoever speaks frivolously has little modesty. Whoever has little modesty has little restraint, and whoever has little restraint enters the Fire. 2. Abstention of the Eyes This involves restraining them from seeing whatever is forbidden according to the shari`ah of Islam. Tell the people of faith to avert their eyes and to guard their private parts... [24:30] Lowering the gaze is expected from the serious seeker. Desires that arise from seeing can cause distractions that can be subtle and subconscious as well as gross and action-oriented. A blind person may be spared these distractions (unless he or she regains his/her sight). 3. Abstention of the Ears The ears must be restrained from hearing whatever is forbidden in shari`ah , like slander and gossip, music and songs that entice lower tendencies, and listening to the talk of the misguided and the corrupt. 4. Abstention of the Sense of Smell This refers to abstaining from both foul odors as well as exciting scents. Foul odors cause aversion and disgust, whereas sweet scent may excite desires and pleasures. 5. Abstention of the Sense of Taste The meaning here relates to avoidance of whatever may veil the faculty of reason, such as imbibing intoxicating beverages, or by acquiring a taste for usury and unfair profit, abuse of orphans, the poor and the weak, and various other \u2018prohibitive\u2019 tastes and habits which will hinder one\u2019s spiritual progress. And do not approach the property of the orphan except in the best manner... [6:152] But those who take usury will rise up on the Day of Resurrection like someone tormented by Satan\u2019s touch. [2:275] 6. Abstention of the Sense of Touch This relates to abstaining from touching whatever may lead to forbidden actions, or to excesses in permitted actions, or to go beyond the limits of balance. They will say to their skins, \u201cwhy have you testified against us?\u201d They will reply: \u201cAllah has caused us to speak, it is He who gives speech to everything and He created you in the first instance and to Him you will return.\u201d [41:21] Nor were you discreet lest your ears or your eyes or your skins testify against you. [41:22] The senses have been created to function in harmony and balance regarding worldly interactions. Anyone who uses the body and its various parts in a manner for which it was not created is considered to be a wrongdoer and out of balance, which is the opposite of harmony, and, therefore, of justice. One explanation of the following verse: And the places of prostration (mas\u0101jid) are for Allah, so therefore do not call upon anyone with Allah, [72:18] is that the human points of prostration include the seven points where the physical body touches the ground. These include the forehead, the two hands, the two knees, and the two feet. These places of prostration are for Allah: they belong to Him and are His slaves, so do not use them in anything which is not pleasing to Him or in anything for which they were not created. Inner Abstentions Inner abstentions are five: The First Abstention refers to restraining the mind from being occupied with base or worldly concerns. The mind is where reasoning and intellect are developed for interaction with the world. When used properly they lead to rational and good understanding. The Prophet has taught that the contemplation of one hour is better than the actions of seventy years. The Second Abstention is to use the mind and intellect to learn about creation and appropriate boundaries and limitations. ...those who preserve Allah\u2019s limits. [9:112] The Third Abstention involves restraining the imaginal power ( khay\u0101l \u2013 the faculty which enables us to construct entities or ideas which do not physically exist, such as a \u2018flying cat\u2019) so that its activity is limited to the purpose for which it was created, which is the perception of things in their true higher reality without being overcome by fantasy and foolish imagery. Allah did not create this power for any reason other than to deduce the meaning behind the world of matter. The power of imagination inspired the Pharaoh and his people to imagine that the transformation of the staff of Musa into a serpent was merely a result of magic. The Fourth Abstention is restraining the power of illusion (and values or meanings given to events or situations) which makes one hate someone one minute and love someone else the next. This \u2018 wahm \u2019 prevents one from steadfastness and perseverance on the path of spiritual evolvement. It will cause one to fall prey to the delusion of love and hate and other confusions. Whoever possesses a \u2018Tranquil Soul\u2019 is free of all of this as he is in the station of witnessing his Beloved and His acts, and \u2018anything the Beloved does is loved\u2019. Whoever is in this state of witnessing One Reality has no enmity for anyone nor concern. Allah addresses the one who has attained this station: O soul that art at rest! Return to your Lord pleased [with Him] and well-pleasing [Him]. [89:27-28] Whoever truly fasts is the one who possesses a soul that is at rest or tranquil and is not possessed or controlled by his lower self. The Fifth Abstention deals with restraining the combined senses as they manifest themselves, both in subjective thoughts ( wahm ) and in the imagination, and as they constantly appear to the self in both form and meaning. This is naturally an obstacle to progress on the Path, because anyone who is occupied with the senses is veiled from the real significance that lies behind them. Likewise, anyone who is preoccupied with their illusions and self-given values will be veiled from true meaning. \"The One who is veiled, is veiled, regardless of whether it is by one veil or a thousand.\" Consequently, the one who fasts must abstain from the likes of these so that he may be free of all veils and witness his Beloved in the manner we have discussed. The Fast of the Gnostic The Men of Allah consider the self to be like a tree with ten branches. Each branch naturally takes its share of nutrients which the tree imbibes from the earth. If, however, we suppose that nine of these branches are cut off then the power of those branches and the nutrients which originally went to them would now go to the one remaining branch; it would grow larger and its fruit would be sweeter and bigger. So it is with the self of man. If man ceases to be attached to the world which surrounds him and his attachment is to the trunk then no doubt the fruits of his thought will be loftier, greater, more powerful, and more honorable. The fast of the Gnostic consists of abstaining from witnessing anything other than Allah. Consequently, anyone fasting at this level abstains from anything other than their Beloved, for they assert that there is nothing in existence other than Allah (the Exalted), Allah\u2019s Names, Attributes and Actions; thus, everything relates to Allah, by Allah, and from Allah. This is because anybody who does not restrain his self from witnessing other than Allah is a mushrik , and the fast of the mushrik is not accepted, nor is his prayer, because praying and fasting cleanse the inner from the impurity of seeing another with Allah, and from the illusion of the grossness and the filth of \u2018otherness\u2019 with the water of Unity and the light of faith based on knowledge. It is obvious in prayer and other acts of worship that one cannot cleanse the inner unless the outer is cleansed by way of wudu\u2019 or ghusl . Likewise, the fast is not valid for the mushrik , whether his shirk be open or concealed, because every mushrik rejects Reality (i.e. a k\u0101fir ) and every k\u0101fir is a mushrik , as Allah has stated: And whoever associates (others) with Allah has indeed gone far astray. [4:116] The following verse elucidates the meaning of concealed shirk : Thus, whoever seeks to meet his Lord then let him do good actions and not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord. [18:110] If this is an allusion to one who was openly associating others with Allah, Allah would have said: \u2018...and not associate anyone with his Lord.\u2019 But when He says \u2018in the worship of his Lord\u2019 we know that this is an allusion to one who secretly or inadvertently associates others with Allah, who are referred to as being \u2018believers\u2019 and \u2018Muslims\u2019, as Allah has said: And most of them do not believe in Allah without associating (others with Him). [12:106] And recall what the Prophet said: The infiltration of shirk into my people is more hidden than the creeping of a black ant upon a black stone on a dark night. The awakened seeker must give up the illusion of seeing actions as coming from other than Allah so that by this realization he may arrive at the station of the Unity of Action. Then he must go past the illusion of seeing Attributes other than those of Allah. That is the station of the Unity of Attributes. Finally, he must go past the veil of \u2018independent\u2019 entities or events \u2013 in Truth, there is no Reality except the One Reality, Allah. That is the station of the Unity of Essence, which is the goal of the Path, and indeed, the goal of existence itself.","title":"Part 3"},{"location":"reflections/practice/fasting/part-3/#outward-abstentions","text":"","title":"Outward abstentions"},{"location":"reflections/practice/fasting/part-3/#1-abstention-of-the-tongue","text":"This concerns useless, foolish, or discourteous speech, as well as anything which would be contrary to what pleases Allah.

Likewise, anyone who is preoccupied with their illusions and self-given values will be veiled from true meaning. \"The One who is veiled, is veiled, regardless of whether it is by one veil or a thousand.\" Consequently, the one who fasts must abstain from the likes of these so that he may be free of all veils and witness his Beloved in the manner we have discussed.","title":"The Fifth Abstention"},{"location":"reflections/practice/fasting/part-3/#the-fast-of-the-gnostic","text":"The Men of Allah consider the self to be like a tree with ten branches. Each branch naturally takes its share of nutrients which the tree imbibes from the earth. If, however, we suppose that nine of these branches are cut off then the power of those branches and the nutrients which originally went to them would now go to the one remaining branch; it would grow larger and its fruit would be sweeter and bigger. So it is with the self of man. If man ceases to be attached to the world which surrounds him and his attachment is to the trunk then no doubt the fruits of his thought will be loftier, greater, more powerful, and more honorable. The fast of the Gnostic consists of abstaining from witnessing anything other than Allah. Consequently, anyone fasting at this level abstains from anything other than their Beloved, for they assert that there is nothing in existence other than Allah (the Exalted), Allah\u2019s Names, Attributes and Actions; thus, everything relates to Allah, by Allah, and from Allah. This is because anybody who does not restrain his self from witnessing other than Allah is a mushrik , and the fast of the mushrik is not accepted, nor is his prayer, because praying and fasting cleanse the inner from the impurity of seeing another with Allah, and from the illusion of the grossness and the filth of \u2018otherness\u2019 with the water of Unity and the light of faith based on knowledge. It is obvious in prayer and other acts of worship that one cannot cleanse the inner unless the outer is cleansed by way of wudu\u2019 or ghusl . Likewise, the fast is not valid for the mushrik , whether his shirk be open or concealed, because every mushrik rejects Reality (i.e. a k\u0101fir ) and every k\u0101fir is a mushrik , as Allah has stated: And whoever associates (others) with Allah has indeed gone far astray. [4:116] The following verse elucidates the meaning of concealed shirk : Thus, whoever seeks to meet his Lord then let him do good actions and not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord. [18:110] If this is an allusion to one who was openly associating others with Allah, Allah would have said: \u2018...and not associate anyone with his Lord.\u2019 But when He says \u2018in the worship of his Lord\u2019 we know that this is an allusion to one who secretly or inadvertently associates others with Allah, who are referred to as being \u2018believers\u2019 and \u2018Muslims\u2019, as Allah has said: And most of them do not believe in Allah without associating (others with Him). [12:106] And recall what the Prophet said: The infiltration of shirk into my people is more hidden than the creeping of a black ant upon a black stone on a dark night. The awakened seeker must give up the illusion of seeing actions as coming from other than Allah so that by this realization he may arrive at the station of the Unity of Action. Then he must go past the illusion of seeing Attributes other than those of Allah. That is the station of the Unity of Attributes. Finally, he must go past the veil of \u2018independent\u2019 entities or events \u2013 in Truth, there is no Reality except the One Reality, Allah. That is the station of the Unity of Essence, which is the goal of the Path, and indeed, the goal of existence itself.","title":"The Fast of the Gnostic"},{"location":"reflections/practice/fasting/part-4/","text":"Excerpts from Shaykh Fadhlalla's book Transformative Worship in Islam: Experiencing Perfection . Shaykh Ahmad al-`Alawi said that whoever has arrived at this station cannot see anything other than Allah even if he intends to do so. He also said that when it is established within one\u2019s self that it is an obligation to abstain from anything other than Allah, the self will begin to long for the knowledge of Allah, and this is like what occurs with the rising of the crescent moon of Ramadan: Whoever among you witnesses the month, let him fast... [2:185] This station is that of witnessing or seeing, first outwardly and then in the subtle spiritual realms, and whoever does not raise his head will not witness the spiritual realms of the heavens and the earth. The determination and concern of the seeker should not be concentrated in the senses as this will cause the heart to turn away from witnessing the Lord. It is for this reason that he abandons everything which reaches him by way of the senses. The seeker will not be able to concentrate his will and direction until he is detached from his senses. The senses may dominate the outward, as one of the Masters has said that the senses will obliterate meaning unless the senses become the essence of meaning themselves. Shaykh al-`Alawi says that the self of the seeker is afflicted by separation which is often expressed as being in a state of jan\u0101bah ; absorption in Allah, then, is forbidden to him and the veil will descend upon him because of the existence of this obstacle. When the barrier is removed, then the seeker is obliged to make up whatever he missed. Allah has warned those who are not patient with \u2018one food\u2019 [2:61], that is, with the Unity of Essence, and who long for anything other than that from among the realms of creation, when He said: Would you exchange that which is good for that which is low and base? Then go down to a city and your wish will be granted... [2:61] The significance of \u2018city\u2019 here is that it represents the consuming self with all that it contains of desires and expectations both open and hidden. This is alluded to in: ...from whatever the earth causes to grow of greens, cucumbers, garlic, lentils and onions. [2:61] Here Allah alludes to the desires of the self which lead to degradation: ...and they were afflicted with degradation and helplessness and were forced to endure anger from Allah. [2:61] This is the state when the lower self is in command and the way out is to take strength by way of the friendship of Allah. For this reason it is said that if you want strength which will not vanish, then do not take pride in strength which will vanish. Whoever fasts the fast of haqiqah , and consequently abstains from anything other than Allah, is fasting according to the following hadith qudsi : For every good action there is the recompense of ten to seven hundred times its worth except fasting, for, indeed, it is solely for Me and I shall surely be the reward. At the earlier phases of spiritual evolvement, the fast is rewarded by the Garden, joy, houris and palaces, or by nearness, attainment, unveiling, and witnessing. At the advanced level the fast has its reward in Allah Himself, the Granter of rewards. The difference between the fast of the people of tariqah and that of the people of haqiqah is that the former is a means for refining the behavior and taking on the Attributes of Allah, as the Prophet said: Mould your character with Allah\u2019s Attributes. The fast of the people of haqiqah , on the other hand, is a means of attaining annihilation and of cleansing oneself by Allah in the station of Pure Unity, which is referred to as annihilation in Unity; as Allah has said in a hadith qudsi : Whoever has sought Me has found Me. Whoever has found Me has come to know Me. Whoever has known Me has loved Me. Whoever has loved Me I have slain. Whomever I have slain the payment of the blood money is on Me, and I will Myself be the payment for the blood money that I owe. One relevant example often given is that of a lump of charcoal and fire. Suppose that there is a strong fire which is described in terms of light, burning, and heat, and that next to it lays charcoal which may be described as dark and cold. As this charcoal is gradually moved closer to the fire, we see that it begins to take on the same characteristics as the fire as fire begins to glow from the charcoal itself. Thus, the charcoal becomes fire and no longer remains charcoal. These parables We make for the people and they are not understood except by the wise. [29:43] The Feast of Fast-Breaking (`Id al-fitr) This feast that marks the end of the month of fasting alludes to the breaking of the fast which cannot be realized as long as the seeker\u2019s senses are suppressed, for during the correct fast the senses are made redundant. If the senses return to him from his Lord that is indeed what is sought after; it is this which is referred to as the `Id , \u2018that which returns\u2019 (from the word `ada , which means to return). The seeker abandons his senses because he abstains from sensual contact and worldly pleasures. But if the senses actually become conveyors of meaning rather than mere physical experiences, then he no longer needs to abandon them. When this occurs, the senses, the meaning, the uniqueness of Allah and His allegorical similarities become as one: ...Thus wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah. [2:115] It is with this same meaning that one Master has said: I penetrated the outward and discovered the inward. I examined the inward and found it to be the outward. Thus, there is no inside to the inward and no outside to the outward and I found it to be in accordance with the meaning which is taken from Allah\u2019s words: \u2018He is the First, the Last, the Apparent and the Hidden.\u2019 [57:3] We find that most of the great Masters in their later stages appreciate human companionship from which they were alienated earlier on. After spiritual solitude and meditation ( khalwah ), the entire existence for them becomes as if it were solitude in which they see only One Reality, and that is exactly what is sought after from the beginning. If the seeker returns to creation and humankind before being immersed and absorbed in the witnessing of Allah, then he has broken his covenant and his fast is invalid.","title":"Part 4"},{"location":"reflections/practice/fasting/part-4/#the-feast-of-fast-breaking-id-al-fitr","text":"This feast that marks the end of the month of fasting alludes to the breaking of the fast which cannot be realized as long as the seeker\u2019s senses are suppressed, for during the correct fast the senses are made redundant.

People who adhere to specific religions or paths consider theirs to be superior to others, even though there may be as many ways to God as there are human beings. The illusion of separation is the cause of all ignorance. The quest and need for a path arises due to the illusory experience of a separate identity and personal point of view.

This section describes the three basic pillars, which are Islam (surrender, submission, acceptance), Iman (trust, faith) and Ihsan (contentment, excellence). Harmonious and wholesome human interaction and behaviour is seamlessly connected to divinity. Being correct and courteous in all our actions naturally leads us to question the meanings behind the dynamics of all activity. True inquiry is born and fostered through faith; awareness; trust in the oneness of reality; and an evolving, unfolding knowing that grows from seeing and examining yourself, your thoughts, and your actions within the wider framework of three of life's major forces - connection, continuity and consciousness.

There are endless levels of realities and the higher points are near the origin of what is constant and perpetual. Whatever reminds us of the ever-present is generally a desirable state. The ever-changing ego celebrates its perpetual origin, the soul within the heart. The soul is a reflector of what is eternal and perpetual and enables us to appreciate an experience of eternal Reality.

On this page, you will find 5 longer talks given by Shaykh Fadhlalla in Sweden in August 2017 in which he goes into detail on the theme of Ultimate Contentment. In Perfect Joy, In Timeless Bliss Some time ago, I was asked to give my first public talk on Muharram to a crowd of British Muslims. I prayed for inspiration, and that night had a wonderful dream. There was a fine black tent, stretching towards the horizon. I was taken inside and saw the Prophet (pbuh) and his family scattered in different parts of the tent. Imam Ali beckoned to me and said, \u2018You wanted to talk to my sons, and here they are.\u2019 Both Imam Hassan and Imam Hussein appeared, as young men, cheerfully exchanging pleasantries. I cautiously approached Imam Hussein and asked, \u2018Do I have your permission to talk about your martyrdom?\u2019 \u2018Of course you can\u2019, he replied, \u2018but only if you depict me as you see me now; in perfect joy, in timeless bliss \u2013 not in any other way.\u2019 Now \u2013 The Gateway of Eternity Allah\u2019s protection and care is forever covering us. It is only we who go to the past and resurrect the dead. That is why the true mu\u2019min regrets at the time, asks Allah\u2019s forgiveness and moves on. We don\u2019t constantly go and visit the scene of the crime. Expect the best of Allah and remember that one of His qualities as it is described in the Qur\u2019an is al-\u2018Afuw . It is from the word \u2018af\u0101 . It means effacing, obliterating, or wiping out, and hence, to pardon. From the same root \u2018afuw comes \u2018\u0101fiyah , meaning wellbeing. The past doesn\u2019t exist anymore because time, in reality, doesn\u2019t exist. It is only as part of His \u2018catchment\u2019, so that we are in time and space yearning for non-time and non-space. Though in reality the past does not exist, we are the product of it. Insofar as we are the evidence it is relevant, but no more. The rest is mental sickness and the emotional stupidity of going back and forth in time \u2013 which robs us of presence. That is why one of the main conditions of a sal\u0101t that truly energizes us is hud\u016br (presence) of our hearts. That is why when we do wudu we stop connecting with the world and are now totally and utterly connected through our hearts and our r\u016bh to our Creator \u2013 this helps us be present. All the ritual practices of Islam enhance our presence; they make us reflect and available totally. The only contact we have with Allah is now. Yesterday is of no use and we don\u2019t know if we will be here tomorrow or not. The only gift we have is the present moment. If the moment is fully and utterly treasured then we are at the gateway of eternity.

I cautiously approached Imam Hussein and asked, \u2018Do I have your permission to talk about your martyrdom?\u2019 \u2018Of course you can\u2019, he replied, \u2018but only if you depict me as you see me now; in perfect joy, in timeless bliss \u2013 not in any other way.\u2019","title":"In Perfect Joy, In Timeless Bliss"},{"location":"videos/conversations/ultimate-contentment/#now-the-gateway-of-eternity","text":"Allah\u2019s protection and care is forever covering us. It is only we who go to the past and resurrect the dead. That is why the true mu\u2019min regrets at the time, asks Allah\u2019s forgiveness and moves on. We don\u2019t constantly go and visit the scene of the crime. Expect the best of Allah and remember that one of His qualities as it is described in the Qur\u2019an is al-\u2018Afuw . It is from the word \u2018af\u0101 . It means effacing, obliterating, or wiping out, and hence, to pardon. From the same root \u2018afuw comes \u2018\u0101fiyah , meaning wellbeing. The past doesn\u2019t exist anymore because time, in reality, doesn\u2019t exist. It is only as part of His \u2018catchment\u2019, so that we are in time and space yearning for non-time and non-space. Though in reality the past does not exist, we are the product of it. Insofar as we are the evidence it is relevant, but no more. The rest is mental sickness and the emotional stupidity of going back and forth in time \u2013 which robs us of presence. That is why one of the main conditions of a sal\u0101t that truly energizes us is hud\u016br (presence) of our hearts. That is why when we do wudu we stop connecting with the world and are now totally and utterly connected through our hearts and our r\u016bh to our Creator \u2013 this helps us be present. All the ritual practices of Islam enhance our presence; they make us reflect and available totally. The only contact we have with Allah is now. Yesterday is of no use and we don\u2019t know if we will be here tomorrow or not. The only gift we have is the present moment. If the moment is fully and utterly treasured then we are at the gateway of eternity.
