# Patterns of Existence

Patterns of Existence presents Shaykh Fadhlalla's reflections on truth and reality. These reflections provide food for thought on critical matters that seekers are facing on a daily basis. This short and succinct series of video provides observations on critical matters that we face.

This series wasn edited, directed & produced by Abbas Bilgrami for the SFH Foundation. We recommend you watch the full playlist on YouTube, and provide just a single glimpse on this page to whet your appetite.
