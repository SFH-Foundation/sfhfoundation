# Surat al-Hadid Tafsir

On this page, you will find a collection of shorter clips cut from a conversation between Shaykh Fadhlalla and Shaykh Muslim about _Surat al-Hadid_. In order to introduce this work properly, please reflect for a moment on these excerpts from two of Shaykh Fadhlalla's books specifically discussing the Qur'an, _"[Beams of Illumination from the Divine Revelation](../../../books/quran/keys/keys-3/)"_ and _“[The Heart of the Qur’an and the Perfect Mizan – Surat Yā Sīn](../../../books/quran/heart-quran-perfect-mizan)”_:

## The Eye of Ḥaqīqah and the Eye of Sharī’ah

Everything is divine. If we view everything with the vision of divinity within us, if we look through the eye of the Creator within us, we find that everything is perfect, and if we do not do this, then everything appears unjust. If we see things with a low, base vision of life we find that everything is imperfect. We are, however, given numerous opportunities to serve the highest ends and to polish ourselves. When we look through the eye of _sharī‘ah_, everything may appear to be in a dreadful state. Therefore, an opportunity is given to us according to our situation to serve, to do good, to help, to work, to improve others, and to uphold true Islamic values. If we look through the eye of the ḥaqīqah, then everything is perfect. There are transgressions, there are failings, and things may appear miserable, but everything is nevertheless in perfection. We are the _barzakh_ (the inter-space, the meeting point) of both possibilities; we contain them both.

## Knowledge Already Exists Within

Man’s purpose is to dispel ignorance. Knowledge already exists within. Knowledge is from Allah’s Attribute of _al-‘Alīm_, the Knower. This Attribute is never absent, so one’s task is simply to strip away ignorance. Divine knowledge (_al-‘ilm al-ladunī_) is already within us, and to arrive at it we must learn prescriptive outer knowledge and proper courtesy, which are all based on the prophetic practices of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).
