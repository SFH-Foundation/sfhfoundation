This page collects a series of talks on the Qur’an broadcast fortnightly in the middle of 2020 as the world continues to deal with the fact of global pandemic.

The dot from which creation began is a puzzle. The Qur’an offers us insights into the creation myth of Adam, of good and evil, and the temporal hierarchies of matter, form, essence and spirit. Scientist Dr. Adnan al-Adnani and Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri consider the rise of human consciousness and intelligence emerging from divine mystery through divine mercy, animated by common drives that relate to desired destinies.
