# Living Qur’an

<div class="callout">
A wholesome mind has no option other than to accept the challenging gift of life and to try to interact with creation in smooth and natural ways, harmonious with body, mind and heart.
</div>

## Introduction

The dot from which creation began is a puzzle. The Qur’an offers us insights into the creation myth of Adam, of good and evil, and the temporal hierarchies of matter, form, essence and spirit. Dr. Adnan al-Adnani and Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri consider the rise of human consciousness and intelligence emerging from divine mystery through divine mercy, animated by common drives that relate to desired destinies.
