Healthy life is a practice of flow with the eternal grace which envelops the whole cosmos and gives rise to the first question, "Who are and why are you here?" You are a celestial soul or spirit on an earthly voyage exploring duality, yearning for your source and origin of unity. The main reason you are on this journey is to recognise the interplay between dualities emerging from unity and submerging back into it with imperfections. For you to lose the veil of identity in space and time, for the soul to return to its natural boundlessness and eternal nature.

## Why Are We Here?

The purpose of our existence is to practice and experience the ever-present, unifying field between diverse entities and realities. The Absolute is ever-present and the permanent reality is the Absolute itself.

Our rise in knowledge and consciousness occurs through leaving behind what we already know

## What To Do? 




Duality appears as soon as creation begins and with it comes the discrimination between left and right, up and down, good and bad, acceptable or what is to be rejected.  Duality begins with discernment of what is high and what is low or what is local and what is universal or more prevalently as to what is inner and what is outer.  The outer is evident, we can all share and care and exchange views about it.  The inner is subtler and subtler and its origin is from the inception of creation.  So we as human beings experience only the outer manifestation of what we call real but its root lies in the unseen.  We can call it energy but eventually even that disappears.  The inner and the outer are always in balance.

We all pursue and desire contentment and the happy moment without fears, sorrow and insecurity, which are all characteristic of temporary and conditioned consciousness. To do your utmost in the present moment with constant reference to absolute truth and practice. This emanates from timelessness with total acceptance that the darkness of our temporary state is only understood due to the light of the permanent soul within. 

The idea of free will is part


You are a passing guest on earth. Your life continues after you die as your soul is not separate from perpetual life. If you do not wake up during your earthly journey, you will wake up after you die.
