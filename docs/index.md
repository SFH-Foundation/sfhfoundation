# SFH Knowledge Archive

Human beings are living in a world where the challenges they face are increasingly complex. This refers to both the modern realities of day-to-day living, as well as the age-old human drive to know and realise the meaning of life, which is continuous. Religions have served a great purpose in bringing stability and justice to diverse beings. The higher purpose of religion has always been to awaken people to the ever-present sacred Cosmic Reality, which governs all that occurs within space and time.

## Need & response  

The SFH Foundation had come about as a consequence of making the essence of Islam and Sufism accessible to people from diverse cultures. It is based on the light of the Qur’an and prophetic transformative methods to sacred realization.

## Hope  

To present understandable facets of realities and the dynamics of the forces in life, so that effort is made to live a meaningful and balanced life with hope and justice and the experience of higher consciousness. Every human being is a soul or spirit far greater than the limitations of the space and time in which they experience life.

## Goal

Provide a single source of information about an optimum way of being. We use the accessible language and symbolism developed by Shaykh Haeri in order to present the timeless prophetic teachings and relate them to the modern world.

> There is nothing new in our search for freedom. There is nothing new in our ability to reach that state of limitless freedom, and there is nothing new in the fact that the only way to that freedom is by our submission to truth and thereby our awakening to it. The only new dimension is time itself, for the moment never repeats. It is forever fresh and new.

> As Abi ibn Ali Talib said, 'You are the evident book by whose signs that which was hidden becomes apparent'. The greatest puzzle is that the eternal secret is ever effulgent. But are our eyes strong enough to look at the sun?"

The only contact we have with Allah is now. Yesterday is of no use and we don’t know if we will be here tomorrow or not. The only gift we have is the present moment. If the moment is fully and utterly treasured then we are at the gateway of eternity.
