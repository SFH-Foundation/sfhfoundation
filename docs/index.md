# SFH Knowledge Archive

![SFH in prayer](./assets/images/sfh_prayer.jpg)

The goal of this archive is to provide a single source of information about an optimum way of being. We use the accessible language and symbolism developed by Shaykh Fadlalla Haeri in order to present the timeless prophetic teachings and relate them to the modern world. We attempt to accomplish this goal through three main areas:

1. [Website](https://sfhfoundation.com) - An easy to understand site that anyone can navigate
2. [Audio](https://sfhfoundation.com) - Various recordings of the Shaykh's talks
3. [Newsletter](https://sfhfoundation.substack.com) - Our community newsletter

This site is the core of SFH Foundation. Our knowledge is open source and hosted on GitHub which means that anyone has the ability to contribute. The goal is to make sure the information is available, clear, concise and up to date.
