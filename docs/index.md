# SFH Knowledge Archive

Welcome to the Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri Foundation Knowledge Archive. Here, you'll be able to work your way through the embankment of knowledge and insight provided by the Shaykh; from the many books he has written, to the articles and guides he has created, talks he has given, and other appearances he has made in more recent years.

> A little learning is a dangerous thing;  
> Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring:  
> There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,  
> And drinking largely sobers us again.  

The goal of this archive is to provide a single source of information about an optimum way of being. We use the accessible language and symbolism developed by the Shaykh in order to present the timeless prophetic teachings and relate them to the modern world.

>"For once we have observed the divine transcendent beauty and majesty in creation, we wish to remain in that state. The truth is that we are already in that unified state, but it is up to us to remain conscious of it. This is the choice given to us."

> There is nothing new in our search for freedom. There is nothing new in our ability to reach that state of limitless freedom, and there is nothing new in the fact that the only way to that freedom is by our submission to truth and thereby our awakening to it. The only new dimension is time itself, for the moment never repeats. It is forever fresh and new.

> As Abi ibn Ali Talib said, 'You are the evident book by whose signs that which was hidden becomes apparent'. The greatest puzzle is that the eternal secret is ever effulgent. But are our eyes strong enough to look at the sun?"

The only contact we have with Allah is now. Yesterday is of no use and we donâ€™t know if we will be here tomorrow or not. The only gift we have is the present moment. If the moment is fully and utterly treasured then we are at the gateway of eternity.
