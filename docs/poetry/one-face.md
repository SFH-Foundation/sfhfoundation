# One Face

_By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri from the book “The Four Journeys”_

For years I faced life  
for decades, centuries – forever. 
   
I faced the sun and the moon,  
I faced the moving breeze,  
I faced the wind,  
I faced the rain drizzle and downpour.  
I faced the world and beyond.  
  
Only now I know  
I had only faced myself,  
mirroring the universe  
after wearing down  
all my other selves –  
I now face my real self.
