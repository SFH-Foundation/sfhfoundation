# Awe And More

<div class="aphorism-text">

I love a good surprise  <br/>
willingly accepting  <br/>
anything that touches the boundaries  <br/> 
of mind and its past   <br/>
enjoying the awesome  <br/>
higher zone of awareness  <br/>
higher consciousness  <br/>
timeless and infinite  <br/>
most awe-inspiring  <br/>
it may begin with love and reverence  <br/>
a touch of glorious presence  <br/>
not conceivable by a faint heart  <br/>
concealed  <br/>
slowly even more slowly  <br/>
revealed  <br/>
awe after awe  <br/>
until you're lost in awesomeness  <br/>
on the shore of the Ever-Real. <br/>
