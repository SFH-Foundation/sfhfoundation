# Perpetual Love

<div class="aphorism-text">

Perpetual love has no mortality  <br/>
no dignity  <br/>
no knowledge  <br/>
of what changes  <br/>
except change itself?  <br/>
Movement and change  <br/>
announce the ever-Constant  <br/>
the source of all dignity  <br/>
honour and reality  <br/>
of perfect love  <br/>
in perpetuity.
