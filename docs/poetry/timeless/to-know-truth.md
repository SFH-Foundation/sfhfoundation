# To Know Truth

<div class="aphorism-text">

"Who are you to object?" he asked.  <br/>
He then left us in suspense, with a ray of hope  <br/>
before quenching our thirst  <br/>
whilst we were all lost  <br/>
trusting our mistrust  <br/>
waiting for the next breath  <br/>
waiting for a better life  <br/>
without knowing what it is or why  <br/>
or for how long  <br/>
where is the real story  <br/>
and its end  <br/>
without knowing its beginning  <br/>
is it like truth,  <br/>
without a beginning  <br/>
or an end?  <br/>
Only truth knows truth.
