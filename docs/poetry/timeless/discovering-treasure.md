# Discovering Treasure

<div class="aphorism-text">

To see the magic of it all  <br/>
from the most drab and ordinary, <br/> 
insight emerges from sight  <br/>
revealing how special it is  <br/>
the transitory reveals perpetuity <br/> 
the origin always prevails  <br/>
each speck of dust  <br/>
reveals its universal origin  <br/>
measurable size and durability  <br/>
no other mental delusions  <br/>
reducing the most precious jewel to a common pebble  <br/>
loss of value  <br/>
the ultimate loss  <br/>
darkness of hell  <br/>
but the heart promises paradise  <br/>
heard from far and near  <br/>
the divine call  <br/>
revealing the treasure.<br/>
