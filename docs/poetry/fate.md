# Fate

_By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri from the book “The Four Journeys”_

Fate is Now.  
  
It is the experience of the moment,  
not the past or future.  
  
It is the Presence,  
the sacred sun,  
which wipes out shadows of doubt  
filling the cup of life.  
  
The wind of Destiny  
blows one over the sand dune.  
In the hourglass,  
trembling as life,  
whispering to the soul  
The true Presence  
on its journey.  
  
Leaving behind  
traces of the past,  
for the Sacred Soul  
is free from past, present and future  
and sings only  
the melody of eternal Now.
