# Troubles

_Taken from “The Four Journeys” by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri_

"You trouble me"  
I announced  
to myself.  
  
"Yes,  
You  
Disturb me  
Burden me  
Hurt me."  
  
Yet all these troubles  
distract me  
from me  
for a while.  
  
Then the resident despot  
asserts a new self, reinvented.  
  
A new old story takes me back to nowhere  
where I may end up as  
Real me.
