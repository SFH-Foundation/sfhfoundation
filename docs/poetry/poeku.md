## The Origin

Haiku is a type of short form poetry originally from Japan. Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases that contain a kireji, or "cutting word", 17 syllables in in a 5, 7, 5 pattern, and a kigo, or seasonal reference. Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified as senryū. 

"Haiku" in English is a term sometimes loosely applied to any short, impressionistic poem, but there are certain characteristics that are commonly associated with the genre:

1. a focus on nature or the seasons
2. a division into two asymmetrical sections that juxtaposes two subjects (e.g. something natural and something human-made, two unexpectedly similar things, etc.)
3. a contemplative or wistful tone and an impressionistic brevity
4. "telegram style" syntax; no superfluous words
5. an emphasis on imagery over exposition
6. avoidance of metaphor and similes
6. non-rhyming lines

Senryū is a 3-line unrhymed Japanese poem structurally similar to haiku but treating human nature usually in an ironic or satiric vein.

PoeKu is an unrhymed poem that Shaykh Fadhlalla created using Haiku-like form. It is ironic, self-effacing, profound poetry with a sense of humour and no rules.
