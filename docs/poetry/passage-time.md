# The Passage of Time

_Taken from “The Four Journeys” by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri_

The day flashes by  
in and out,  
dances about,  
to the instant tune of Time.  
Silhouetted on the screen of illusion,  
slipping down the sand dune of existence,  
perched on the edge of a vast desert  
the infinite non-existence.  
But for he who seeks the Truth  
Time is long and tedious,  
for where is its beginning  
and where is its end?  
For the common man  
Time is to be conquered,  
to be killed.  
  
Killing the stranger,  
killing the nomadic tribe,  
wandering here and there,  
sometimes staying long  
sometimes short – all relative!  
Challenging the fixed city  
with its structures and rules,  
its sand and earth are veiled by asphalt.  
But how to stop the shifting sand  
covering the globe,  
the movement of the hour glass  
or the darting electron?  
So fast yet still.
