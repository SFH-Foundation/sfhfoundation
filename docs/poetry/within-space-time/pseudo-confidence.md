# Pseudo Confidence

<div class="aphorism-text">

Truth  <br/>
sneaks  <br/>
in  <br/>
without permission <br/> 
or expectations  <br/>
like a flash of light <br/> 
illuminates and dazzles  <br/>
and then vanishes again  <br/>
leaving us bewildered and confused  <br/>
only for a moment  <br/>
when we return  <br/>
confused now by normality  <br/>
for everyone agrees  <br/>
it is like this  <br/>
all the time  <br/>
history proves that  <br/>
so does scripture  <br/>
that God said  <br/>
this is meant to be  <br/>
true forever  <br/>
meanwhile  <br/>
everyone remains confused  <br/>
pretending to be confident.  <br/>
