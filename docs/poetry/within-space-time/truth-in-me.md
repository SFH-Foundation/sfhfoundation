# The Truth In Me

<div class="aphorism-text">

I make so many mistakes  <br/>
and try to hide many of them  <br/>
although I know the truth will shine <br/> 
hopefully one day  <br/>
there will be no more mistakes <br/> 
the sage said that will come after death  <br/>
not before  <br/>
you need to be humbled by mistakes  <br/>
so celebrate your errors  <br/>
and celebrate the perfect day  <br/>
and celebrate our desire for perpetual affection  <br/>
celebrate truth  <br/>
celebrate its timelessness  <br/>
celebrate your journey  <br/>
grappling with it, to it, unto it  <br/>
just celebrate.<br/>
