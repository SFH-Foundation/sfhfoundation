# Noisy Silence

<div class="aphorism-text">

I kept quiet  <br/>
still and almost absent <br/> 
those around weren't happy with my power of silence  <br/>
I was content and ignored the chatter  <br/>
silent and noisy  <br/>
the usual human conflicts  <br/>
living whilst dying  <br/>
not as a resolving challenge  <br/>
biographies built on heaps of decomposing rubbish and  <br/>
trash masked with hesitant smiles  <br/>
this is how we polluted the earth with our inner mess  <br/>
then express shock at the outer disaster  <br/>
environmental degradation  <br/>
blaming it on others  <br/>
as for the people nearby  <br/>
who only hope to hear what confirms their views  <br/>
seeking news and views  <br/>
to ensure survival and palliative contentment  <br/>
everybody wants to hear what confirms their mind's clutter  <br/>
Oh God, I need your help  <br/>
I said to myself  <br/>
but this time aloud  <br/>
then returned to silence. <br/>
