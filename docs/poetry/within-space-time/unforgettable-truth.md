# Unforgettable Truth

<div class="aphorism-text">

You forgot again  <br/>
naturally  <br/>
you are often absent minded  <br/>
  <br/>
Awareness of the moment  <br/>
is the start of the path of true remembrance  <br/>
pure and complete awareness  <br/>
unattached to anything  <br/>
neither time nor place  <br/>
a pure imprint of the eternal  <br/>
perfect presence.  <br/>
  <br/>
Most people are like you  <br/>
living in darkness and confusion  <br/>
but for your own sake  <br/>
remember  <br/>
before it's too late  <br/>
be present at the moment  <br/>
when creation began  <br/>
at that point everything  <br/>
is present  <br/>
even our moment in time  <br/>
now.  <br/>
