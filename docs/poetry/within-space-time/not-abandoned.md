# Not Abandoned

<div class="aphorism-text">

I am not forgotten  <br/>
they called today  <br/>
wanting to see me  <br/>
I am missed they said  <br/>
but in truth they don't know who  <br/>
they are  <br/>
we all live in confused amnesia most of the time  <br/>
on rare occasions we are called normal  <br/>
I did have the illusion of missing something or other  <br/>
or fearing abandonment  <br/>
then I switched to actually desiring seclusion  <br/>
they think I've found something  <br/>
special and most valuable  <br/>
they are both right and wrong  <br/>
everyone seeks his treasure  <br/>
looking for it ensures its elusiveness  <br/>
masses of earthly collusions  <br/>
with no clear conclusions  <br/>
unless you abandon whatever is on earth  <br/>
everything within space and time  <br/>
conditioned  <br/>
limited  <br/>
and ever changing. <br/> \
