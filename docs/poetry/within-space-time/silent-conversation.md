# Silent Conversation

<div class="aphorism-text">

Silence whispered into my ear  <br/>
"to know the story of earth  <br/>
ask the heavens"  <br/>
Then it whispered in the other ear  <br/>
"as for the story of the heavens, ask the earth" -<br/>   
identical twins separated in space  <br/>
  <br/>
But to know who you are there is no one to ask  <br/>
just embrace silence and pray for grace  <br/>
the rest are colourful traps in time and space <br/> 
guarded by fears, desires,  <br/>
distractions and other fantasies, <br/> 
preparations for suffering  <br/>
sometimes veiled by values  <br/>
like kindness, freedom  <br/>
or service to others  <br/>
and countless other mirages  <br/>
in life's vast desert.  <br/>
