# The Rememdy of Absence

<div class="aphorism-text">

Better to sleep  <br/>
shut down the senses  <br/>
sights, insights and awareness  <br/>
absent from pleasure and pain  <br/>
embracing the void  <br/>
the origin of all absence and presence  <br/>
and time and other distractions  <br/>
for a while or longer  <br/>
then repeat this experience  <br/>
all life long for  <br/>
real presence and its favour  <br/>
may then touch you.  <br/>
After years of drought and darkness  <br/>
the thorn bush noticed its thirst  <br/>
the desert didn't care  <br/>
nor did the oceans or clouds  <br/>
nor the star crudely labelled  <br/>
with long numbers and letters  <br/>
a new challenge  <br/>
maybe a new discovery  <br/>
baring my name  <br/>
a futile tag  <br/>
descriptions and definitions  <br/>
continue in absurdity  <br/>
fitting circles within triangles  <br/>
and claiming efficient outcomes  <br/>
a civilization of absurdities  <br/>
fleeting within misty space  <br/>
and time  <br/>
claiming exactitude  <br/>
hoping for deliverance  <br/>
through precision and exact failures  <br/>
impetuous denials hiding all needs and attachments  <br/>
hiding human frailty  <br/>
hiding the light  <br/>
that illumines all realities  <br/>
always transient  <br/>
and yet constant.  <br/>
