# Big Questions

Back to the original Obsessions.

Who is it?
Why?
What does it want?
Why am I concerned about the future?
What about the fear of death?

What haunts me most is the question of God.

How do I enter the sanctuary?
Now.
Immediately.

Inside the Kaâ€™ba,
there are no questions.

All have vanished without trace,
like midday stars.

Vanished from sight,
only the sun shines now, from above.

And the soul radiates in all directions.
Big Answer.
