# To Remember You Must Forget

_By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri from the book “The Four Journeys”_

You are one,  
or so you think!  
You have one body,  
you have one mind,  
but to put on a new dress  
you must take off the old.  
  
To see clearly  
you must move out of the fog.  
To recognize truth  
you have to leave your past falsehood,  
ideas, memories and values.  
  
Then there is a chance  
for fresh sight,  
insight,  
pure light  
glorious!
