# The First Journey

<div class="aphorism-text">

With disappointment  <br/>
fear,  <br/>
anger and strife  <br/>
there is some hope  <br/>
for a better life;  <br/>
if not soon  <br/>
it may be in the afterlife.  <br/>
  <br/>
We wish to leave behind  <br/>
whatever caused harm  <br/>
looking forward to  <br/>
liberation,  <br/>
peace and joy.  <br/>
  <br/>
This is the hopeful path <br/> 
from creation to Creator,  <br/>
but be warned  <br/>
for near the end  <br/>
there is no way  <br/>
to return.  <br/>
