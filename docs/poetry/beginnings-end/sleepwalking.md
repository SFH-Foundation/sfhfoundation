# Sleepwalking

<div class="aphorism-text">

“I am normal,” the voice declared.  <br/>
“Leave me to sleep  <br/>
for this is my real condition.  <br/>
Do not discuss or fuss,  <br/>
condemning my wide open eyes, <br/> 
your label of ‘wakefulness’  <br/>
falls on a frozen courtyard.  <br/>
My open eyes simply remind me  <br/>
of yesterday  <br/>
and tomorrow,  <br/>
forgetting now.  <br/>
lost between the veils <br/> 
of past and future,  <br/>
lost in dreams.”  <br/>
  <br/>
“So please do not discuss or fuss <br/> 
the blind misleading the blind,  <br/>
dreaming within a dream  <br/>
with no dawn or dusk.  <br/>
That too, I am told,  <br/>
is the real condition  <br/>
of those in addiction.  <br/>
Then I hear there are others  <br/>
considered awakened,  <br/>
not in stupor or sleep.  <br/>
I am told there are others  <br/>
besides us common sleep-walkers,  <br/>
but I am not amongst them.”  <br/>
