# The Passage of Time

<div class="aphorism-text">

The day flashes by  <br/>
in and out,  <br/>
dances about,  <br/>
to the instant tune of Time.  <br/>
Silhouetted on the screen of illusion, <br/> 
slipping down the sand dune of existence,  <br/>
perched on the edge of a vast desert  <br/>
the infinite non-existence.  <br/>
But for he who seeks the Truth  <br/>
Time is long and tedious,  <br/>
for where is its beginning  <br/>
and where is its end?  <br/>
For the common man  <br/>
Time is to be conquered, <br/> 
to be killed.  <br/>
  <br/>
Killing the stranger, <br/> 
killing the nomadic tribe, <br/> 
wandering here and there,  <br/>
sometimes staying long  <br/>
sometimes short â€“ all relative! <br/> 
Challenging the fixed city  <br/>
with its structures and rules,  <br/>
its sand and earth are veiled by asphalt. <br/> 
But how to stop the shifting sand  <br/>
covering the globe,  <br/>
the movement of the hour glass  <br/>
or the darting electron?  <br/>
So fast yet still.  <br/>
