# The Candle

<div class="aphorism-text">

Who can I trust?  <br/>
Where do I belong?  <br/>
Who is worth it?  <br/>
How can I become One?  <br/>
  <br/>
The wax was now soft,  <br/>
But the wick still hidden.  <br/>
The head had to be cleared.  <br/>
Then by grace, the wick was alight. <br/> 
  <br/>
Flickering with new life, <br/> 
Announcing its light.  <br/>
Just Real.  <br/>
Illumining presence.  <br/>
  <br/>
Perfection in sight and insight.  <br/>
Perfect timelessness.  <br/>
