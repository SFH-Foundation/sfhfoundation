# What Is It?

<div class="aphorism-text">

Expressed  <br/>
by light, colour and form  <br/>
movement and vibration  <br/>
presenting itself  <br/>
through constant change <br/> 
and transformation  <br/>
revealed as new existence <br/> 
visible and hidden  <br/>
emanating  <br/>
from essence â€”  <br/>
that which Is  <br/>
perpetual.  <br/>
That is what it is  <br/>

</div>
