# Enlightened Teachers

<div class="aphorism-text">

The awakened beings  <br/>
look out for true seekers  <br/>
and teach,  <br/>
to their inner hearts  <br/>
they reach.  <br/>
They do not preach. <br/> 
  <br/>
Meanwhile they,  <br/>
like everybody else,  <br/>
experience constant change  <br/>
and uncertainty,  <br/>
while anchored in  <br/>
inner constancy,  <br/>
their contented heart at peace. <br/> 
  <br/>
The world does not possess them,  <br/>
though they may possess it.<br/>
Their mistakes inconsequential, <br/> 
their subtle achievements monumental, <br/> 
with their followers gentle,  <br/>
their love for life ample,  <br/>
their lifestyle simple,  <br/>
towards their Creator most humble. <br/> 
  <br/>
So listen attentivelyâ€¦  <br/>
if you find such a being,  <br/>
make a real commitment  <br/>
secure and deep,  <br/>
and of enlightened wisdom  <br/>
absorb and keep.   <br/>
  <br/>
Be in this company  <br/>
with no condition,  <br/>
seeking permission  <br/>
at the door of illumined transmission.  <br/>
