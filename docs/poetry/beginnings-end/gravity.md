# Gravity

<div class="aphorism-text">

Every entity  <br/>
Pulls  <br/>
Towards its heart  <br/>
And centre  <br/>
Expression of  <br/>
Density  <br/>
The self also <br/> 
Pulls  <br/>
And Pushes  <br/>
To and from  <br/>
Whereas  <br/>
Perfect grace <br/> 
Has all  <br/>
In its  <br/>
Embrace  <br/>

</div>
