# Human Modesty

<div class="aphorism-text">

When asked, “What do I control?”  <br/>
I knew the trick,  <br/>
“Nothing!”  <br/>
and then again, “What do you want?” <br/> 
  <br/>
My pretending smile, <br/> 
concealed a million desires, some new, fresh.  <br/>
Others ancient, lost in the storms of timeless cosmic dust. <br/> 
  <br/>
Then again, “How much?”  <br/>
the sky is vast, my passions too. <br/> 
  <br/>
Fireballs, hidden behind rose bushes.  <br/>
Truth within falsehood.  <br/>
Polite.  <br/>
  <br/>
Friendly gestures,  <br/>
taught by a hyena.  <br/>
Circus trained,  <br/>
by robot monkeys.  <br/>
Dressed up as instructors, <br/> 
self assured.  <br/>
