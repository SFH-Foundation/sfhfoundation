# This City Has No Roads

<div class="aphorism-text">

When you are in despair  <br/>
like a dolphin high on a beach  <br/>
its navigation system broken down  <br/>
with no possibility of repair.<br/>
    <br/>
Now, give up!  <br/>
    <br/>
Nowhere to turn, <br/> 
no hope for any place or time. <br/> 
Not tomorrow or next year.  <br/>
Then somewhere, somehow  <br/>
the instant may reveal itself <br/> 
by itself,  <br/>
through no effort <br/> 
other than helplessness. <br/> 
  <br/>
You come to know instantly  <br/>
the meeting point of here and there, <br/> 
beyond the roads  <br/>
and before the travel was invented.  <br/>
  <br/>
For when thirst was created  <br/>
so too was the eternal spring  <br/>
in need of reaching thirsty lips,  <br/>
to be acknowledged  <br/>
grateful,  <br/>
heartful,  <br/>
hopeful.  <br/>
