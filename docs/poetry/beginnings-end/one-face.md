# One Face

<div class="aphorism-text">

For years I faced life  <br/>
for decades, centuries – forever. <br/>
   <br/>
I faced the sun and the moon,  <br/>
I faced the moving breeze,  <br/>
I faced the wind,  <br/>
I faced the rain drizzle and downpour.  <br/>
I faced the world and beyond.  <br/>
  <br/>
Only now I know  <br/>
I had only faced myself,  <br/>
mirroring the universe  <br/>
after wearing down  <br/>
all my other selves –  <br/>
I now face my real self.  <br/>
