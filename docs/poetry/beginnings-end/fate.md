# Fate

<div class="aphorism-text">

Fate is Now.  <br/>
  <br/>
It is the experience of the moment,  <br/>
not the past or future.  <br/>
  <br/>
It is the Presence,  <br/>
the sacred sun,  <br/>
which wipes out shadows of doubt  <br/>
filling the cup of life.  <br/>
  <br/>
The wind of Destiny  <br/>
blows one over the sand dune.  <br/>
In the hourglass,  <br/>
trembling as life,  <br/>
whispering to the soul  <br/>
The true Presence  <br/>
on its journey.  <br/>
  <br/>
Leaving behind  <br/>
traces of the past,  <br/>
for the Sacred Soul  <br/>
is free from past, present and future  <br/>
and sings only  <br/>
the melody of eternal Now. <br/>
