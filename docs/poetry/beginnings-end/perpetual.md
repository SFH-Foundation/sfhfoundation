# Perpetual

<div class="aphorism-text">

Connected continuation.  <br/>
Unified twins.  <br/>
  <br/>
“A futile life” the voice said, “A lie” it said. <br/> 
“The heart knows” it said.  <br/>
  <br/>
“How do we relate?” <br/> 
  <br/>
Now, a star. <br/> 
Illuminated dust. <br/> 
  <br/>
Now, a cry to be heard. <br/> 
Now, an odyssey.  <br/>
  <br/>
A comic tragedy, <br/> 
Labelled reality.  <br/>
Confusing pluralities.  <br/>
  <br/>
Mockery of choices,  <br/>
Guarding unity.  <br/>
And that is what the heart knows. <br/> 
  <br/>
Perpetual truth, <br/> 
Veiled by the head.  <br/>
The heart smiles knowingly.  <br/>
