# Binary Experience

<div class="aphorism-text">

Itâ€™s all done.  <br/>
  <br/>
In fact, gone  <br/>
from where it had come.  <br/>
The immovable now  <br/>
ever present,  <br/>
constant,  <br/>
hiding behind change.  <br/>
  <br/>
Its end before the start,  <br/>
death with birth,  <br/>
inseparable,  <br/>
disguised as duality, <br/> 
clamouring to return  <br/>
to Mother Unity  <br/>
where all is done  <br/>
before any action,  <br/>
actor, stage,  <br/>
or the idea of unity.  <br/>
