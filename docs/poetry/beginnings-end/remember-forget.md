# To Remember You Must Forget

<div class="aphorism-text">

You are one,  <br/>
or so you think!  <br/>
You have one body,  <br/>
you have one mind,  <br/>
but to put on a new dress  <br/>
you must take off the old.  <br/>
  <br/>
To see clearly  <br/>
you must move out of the fog.  <br/>
To recognize truth  <br/>
you have to leave your past falsehood,  <br/>
ideas, memories and values.  <br/>
  <br/>
Then there is a chance  <br/>
for fresh sight,  <br/>
insight,  <br/>
pure light  <br/>
glorious!  <br/>
