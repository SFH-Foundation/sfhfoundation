# Big Questions

<div class="aphorism-text">

Back to the original Obsessions.  <br/>
  <br/>
Who is it?  <br/>
Why?  <br/>
What does it want?  <br/>
Why am I concerned about the future?  <br/>
What about the fear of death?  <br/>
  <br/>
What haunts me most is the question of God.  <br/>
  <br/>
How do I enter the sanctuary?  <br/>
Now.  <br/>
Immediately. <br/> 
  <br/>
Inside the Kaâ€™ba, <br/> 
there are no questions. <br/> 
  <br/>
All have vanished without trace,  <br/>
like midday stars.  <br/>
  <br/>
Vanished from sight,  <br/>
only the sun shines now, from above.  <br/>
  <br/>
And the soul radiates in all directions. <br/> 
Big Answer.  <br/>
