# Step With Caution

<div class="aphorism-text">

Donâ€™t step on the ants  <br/>
for you may kill one,  <br/>
and if you kill one  <br/>
you kill all.  <br/>
  <br/>
When you cut a tree  <br/>
you are on trial.  <br/>
Your intention is evidence,  <br/>
and if you are condemned, then  <br/>
the cloud will tell the rains  <br/>
to roll fast down the hill  <br/>
and wash out earthly crimes,  <br/>
and rush down to Mother Ocean  <br/>
with the news of punishment.  <br/>
  <br/>
Then the birds will disappear, <br/> 
the sky will thunder  <br/>
and the countryside be set alight:  <br/>
to rejuvenate,  <br/>
to remind,  <br/>
to mend,  <br/>
to pour out love, <br/> 
interspersed with thunderclaps  <br/>
and lightning to ignite,  <br/>
to prepare for the birds of paradise, <br/> 
to perch and drink  <br/>
on the evergreen tree free of blight. <br/> 
  <br/>
And the ants will re-build again <br/> 
In praise of life and light.  <br/>
