title: Perpetual

# Perpetual

Connected continuation.
Unified twins.

“A futile life” the voice said, “A lie” it said.
“The heart knows” it said.

“How do we relate?”

Now, a star.
Illuminated dust.

Now, a cry to be heard.
Now, an odyssey.

A comic tragedy,
Labelled reality.
Confusing pluralities.

Mockery of choices,
Guarding unity.
And that is what the heart knows.

Perpetual truth,
Veiled by the head.
The heart smiles knowingly.
