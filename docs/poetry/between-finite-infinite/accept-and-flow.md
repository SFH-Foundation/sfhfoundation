# Accept and Flow

<div class="aphorism-text">

No others  <br/>
not even you  <br/>
have any say or control  <br/>
other than to accept and flow <br/> 
as all that appears  <br/>
mere shadows  <br/>
moving in space and time  <br/>
only to disappear  <br/>
whatever emanates  <br/>
will surely return  <br/>
declaring with passion and honesty  <br/>
there is only that  <br/>
that is what it is  <br/>
it is  <br/>
truly is. <br/>
