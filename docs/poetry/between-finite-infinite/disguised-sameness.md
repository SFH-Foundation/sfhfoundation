# Disguised Sameness

<div class="aphorism-text">

You may do  <br/>
much or less  <br/>
or undo  <br/>
or redo  <br/>
traces appear <br/> 
only to disappear  <br/>
or change  <br/>
emerging from a light  <br/>
named constancy  <br/>
coloured like rainbows <br/> 
and subsiding back  <br/>
to Oneness  <br/>
the home of immensity  <br/>
and where  <br/>
everywhere you look  <br/>
it is utterly  <br/>
the same  <br/>
with a new name  <br/>
why, where and how  <br/>
after endless discovery  <br/>
you awakened to disguised sameness  <br/>
original Oneness.<br/>
