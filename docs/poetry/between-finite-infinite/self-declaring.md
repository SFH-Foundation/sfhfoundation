# Self-Declaring

<div class="aphorism-text">

Whatever you do  <br/>
or don't  <br/>
self-declares  <br/>
life's rainbows  <br/>
whatever appears  <br/>
or exists  <br/>
a message in perpetuity  <br/>
self to self  <br/>
a full circle  <br/>
a full life  <br/>
life from life  <br/>
self-declaring.<br/>

</div>
