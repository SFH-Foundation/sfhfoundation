# The Way Out

<div class="aphorism-text">

Don't block my view  <br/>
I want to know what is there  <br/>
further along  <br/>
where will this quest end  <br/>
fear and hope are my two legs  <br/>
driven by the desire to know  <br/>
the drive for freedom  <br/>
from everything  <br/>
including the idea of freedom  <br/>
moving towards the new horizon  <br/>
the abode of nowhereness  <br/>
but for now, please let me see  <br/>
feel, smell and hear  <br/>
what is here  <br/>
and there  <br/>
my mind demands  <br/>
what I really need  <br/>
is the way out of here  <br/>
towards up there and everywhere  <br/>
without denying what is here  <br/>
please help me.  <br/>
