# Differentiated Sameness

<div class="aphorism-text">

It is always the same  <br/>
and yet different -  <br/>
differentiated sameness!  <br/>
Back to the start!  <br/>
You begin and end!  <br/>
Slow or fast -  <br/>
back to the start!  <br/>
Always ewxperiencing now <br/> 
its echoes   <br/>
past or future  <br/>
here and there  <br/>
everything changes  <br/>
ever different  <br/>
but I am the same -  <br/>
so it seems to me!<br/>
I think.<br/>
