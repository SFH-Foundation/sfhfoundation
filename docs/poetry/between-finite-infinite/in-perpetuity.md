# In Perpetuity

<div class="aphorism-text">

It was a big watermelon  <br/>
many of us enjoyed it  <br/>
distracted folk enjoying the taste and aroma  <br/>
through lips  <br/>
and countless tastebuds  <br/>
the silent watermelon surrendered  <br/>
with grace  <br/>
passing its message through its seeds  <br/>
small black seeds telling the whole story  <br/>
an excuse to connect and continue  <br/>
to glorify life  <br/>
as it knows itself  <br/>
like every other story in history or before  <br/>
please let us read it  <br/>
then we can dance to its music  <br/>
while nature's chorus connects meanings and forms  <br/>
here, there and everywhere  <br/>
at all times and before time  <br/>
in perpetuity.<br/>
