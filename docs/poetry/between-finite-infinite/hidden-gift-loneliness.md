# The Hidden Gift of Loneliness

<div class="aphorism-text">

Due to grace  <br/>
the soul shines upon the ego  <br/>
transcending perpetual earthly loneliness  <br/>
through meditation and silence  <br/>
the eternal moment  <br/>
takes you into the truth of eternity  <br/>
now  <br/>
from which all illusions of tragic absurdities  <br/>
arise and subside  <br/>
like the ocean's tide  <br/>
and higher consciousness reveals  <br/>
that all darkness and loneliness is due  <br/>
to illusions of identity  <br/>
separation from cosmic Oneness  <br/>
and the trap of space and time  <br/>
your loneliness was a life-line extended to you  <br/>
to drive you  <br/>
back to your own soul  <br/>
and cosmic Oneness.<br/>
