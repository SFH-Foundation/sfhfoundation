title: Step With Caution

# Step With Caution

_By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, from the book "The Four Journeys"_.

Donâ€™t step on the ants
for you may kill one,
and if you kill one
you kill all.

When you cut a tree
you are on trial.
Your intention is evidence,
and if you are condemned, then
the cloud will tell the rains
to roll fast down the hill
and wash out earthly crimes,
and rush down to Mother Ocean
with the news of punishment.

Then the birds will disappear,
the sky will thunder
and the countryside be set alight:
to rejuvenate,
to remind,
to mend,
to pour out love,
interspersed with thunderclaps
and lightning to ignite,
to prepare for the birds of paradise,
to perch and drink
on the evergreen tree free of blight.

And the ants will re-build again
In praise of life and light.
