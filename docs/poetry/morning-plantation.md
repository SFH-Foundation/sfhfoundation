title: Morning in the Plantation

# Morning in the Plantation

_By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, from the book "The Four Journeys"_.

Parchment-like, thin as a muslin veil,
The radiant green banana fronds glistened and waved farewell to the morning mist.

Like victory flags parading on the hilltop,
blending the orchard songs of buds, trees and palm fronds,
merging with colours, forms and stillness
unified in the early light
in delight, in symphony, in harmony cloaked in white,
from light unto light
all defined by changing shadows confined to hills and meadows without which there can be no vision nor desperation for divine admission.

And awakening into colourless stillness into the presence of Light-beyond-light the boundless Essence
behind and in front and within all sights â€” _Allah-Hu_.
