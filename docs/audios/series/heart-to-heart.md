## Episode 1

In part one, Shaykh Fadhlalla discusses some key moments in his life and search for truth and reality, drawing parallels to natural stages in the arc of human life and the drive towards truth and higher consciousness. This is a prelude to exploring various fundamental questions such as "Who am I", and "What is it all about". Shaykh Fadhlalla uses these questions to share key elements of his spiritual quest relevant to the Muhammadi path and original Islam:

- ‘Why is it that Muslims are not thrilled and enlivened thrilled with the eternal light by the immense inheritance of knowledge and truth?’ 
- ‘What went wrong?’ 
- ’What is the essential message of the Islamic way and Muhammadi teachings?’

These questions serve as the basis for a saturated presentation, weaving together diverse issues relevant to education; human growth and development; human consciousness; and the nature of self-soul dynamism. A critical aspect of the talk revolves around the duality-unity model reflected by the Qur’an. The essential meaning and problem of authority and the reality of Unity play a key part in understanding this model. Various key polarities and complementarities relevant to the Islamic path are also covered in relation to this broad topic:   

- _Shari’ah_ (boundaries) and _Haqqiqah_ (Reality) 
- a broad overview of the nature of the ego-self 
- the essential meanings and keys towards accountability and inner purification
- _Dhikr_ (remembrance) and
- transcendence

## Episode 2

In this episode, issues relevant to the fundamental driving forces and motivations in human nature are further elaborated. Shaykh Fadhlalla explores in greater detail the questions of:

- "Who am I?"
- "Who is Allah?"
- "What is death?" and 
- "What is the desire to go beyond limitations?" 

A broad map of reality is provided, with a special focus on the micro reality of the human being as a reflection of the macro reality of the cosmos. This theme of human cosmology and make up is discussed in the light of both a bio-evolutionary map, and a psycho-social development arc of an evolving self at various stages of consciousness. The theme of an evolution in consciousness is described and the dual cosmology of human beings is elaborated. The Shaykh describes the nature of truth; where it may lie; and human being’s relationship to their essence. Various scientific discoveries and the role these play in the evolution of human consciousness and understanding of the laws of nthe physical cosmos are also reviewed.

## Episode 3

In this third episode, the theme of human composition is explored in detail. The four interlinking worlds that make up a human evolutionary biography are discussed and mapped in tandem with natural drives and desires present in the unfolding of human life. The uniqueness of human consciousness is presented in relation to our innate capacity and potential towards higher awareness and consciousness. The centrality of the heart is also introduced as the key in wholesome growth and transformation. Various essential issues regarding the application of Islamic spirituality are introduced, emphasizing and describing the nature and necessity of a strong and wholesome foundation which enables the possibility for real progress and transformation towards the higher. There are several key threads in this episode: 

- the nature and seamlessness of _Shariah_ (boundaries) and _Haqqiqah_ (truth); 
- teachers and transmission; 
- Decree and Destiny and its relevance to cosmic laws and decree; 
- the types and degrees of guidance and the role of supplication.

The interplay between outward behavior, conduct and responsibility with subtler opening and inner delight is emphasized in this episode, and the various layers of this issue are described so as to provide appropriate navigation and connection for the traveler seeking to refer to, and live in unison with, original light.

## Episode 4

This episode begins with the human drive and desire for goodness and wellness at every level and pays special attention to the appropriate modes of action and behavior which facilitate natural movement towards goodness and higher consciousness. Various key approaches to the science of the self and the models of classical Sufi masters are introduced and discussed in with an emphasis on the self-soul interface and the nature of spiritual growth. The special nature of modern conditioning and the type of personality structure developed by contemporary culture is a key point in this episode. Shaykh Fadhlalla presents the contrasting, yet complementary keys relevant to accessing the divine potential latent in the heart without denying the sentient creature and its complex, intricate make up. The discussion is intermingled with various Prophetic traditions and Qur’anic verses emphasizing the distilled light of the prophetic path as it applies to meeting and unravelling these issues.
