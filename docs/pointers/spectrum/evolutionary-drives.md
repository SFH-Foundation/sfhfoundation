# Evolutionary Drives

<div class="aphorism-text">

The human quest for freedom and liberation doesn't end except by awakening to the soul's light and its consciousness of the sacred present, beyond space and time and including all that there is within them.  

<div class="div"></div>

It is a natural drive to be in pursuit of real identity and purpose of life.

<div class="div"></div>

An important social drive is to be useful, accepted, and acknowledged by others. 

<div class="div"></div>

It is high intelligence to question the meaning of progress and development and where it leads to so far as fulfilled life is concerned.  

<div class="div"></div>

Every decline or fall contributes to the future rise and evolvement of consciousness.

<div class="div"></div>

We need stability, reliability, and constancy to awaken to the real and perpetual ever-present Truth.  

<div class="div"></div>

Money is power and we love its acquisition until we are at one with the most powerful source - the soul within.  

<div class="div"></div>

Easy success may easily lead to failure.  

<div class="div"></div>

There is some goodness in having a direction, whether good or bad. There is only confusion and loss in meandering aimlessly in darkness.  

<div class="div"></div>

We are indebted to generosity and our ultimate indebtedness is to the source of all generosities - God.
