# Two Zones of Consciousness

<div class="aphorism-text">

Truth becomes effulgent when conditioned consciousness yields to the light. 

<div class="div"></div>

These are two maps for your life's journey: one is for your earthly survival and describes your body, mind and emotions; the other, for arrival, and describes your heavenly state - inner soul, your heart and your resident deity. These two zones do not mix, but complement each other. Read them both side by side and you will enjoy your fate.

<div class="div"></div>

If you have an identity or roles, you are within the confinement of space and time - which you are always struggling to get out of. Your timeless reality is ever constant and boundless.  

<div class="div"></div>

There are two types of poverty: the first relates to outer needs and desires to reduce human hunger and factors for survival and the second is intrinisc- outer wealth may not eradicate it, as the lower self is always in need of the higher.

<div class="div"></div>

Our consciousness is in two zones; one is the earthly limited zone and is never secure. The other is total consciousness of light and delight.   

<div class="div"></div>

Is God in charge of everything or not? Both! According to the lens of spacetime or Absolute Reality; this is the issue of incomparability and similarity. 

<div class="div"></div>

There are always two levels of successful outcomes: one is judged by facts, reason and rationality; the other is to do with eternally present perfection.
