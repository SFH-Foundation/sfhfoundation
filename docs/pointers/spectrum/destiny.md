# Destiny

<div class="aphorism-text">

The best destiny is to be with eternal Oneness.

<div class="div"></div>

Human consciousness is temporary, limited and conditioned, whereas its origin and destiny are eternal, pure consciousness.

<div class="div"></div>

Destiny and origin are twins that reside in timeless infinity.

<div class="div"></div>

Your fate allows your choice.

<div class="div"></div>

Destiny is perfect irrespective or personal judgement and experience.

<div class="div"></div>

Real acceptance of the moment enables you to flow with ease along your destiny.

<div class="div"></div>

Pain prolongs time. What makes distance long is strong emotion and the need to get to your destiny.

<div class="div"></div>

There is no option in desiring options or in hoping to choose the appropriate one.

<div class="div"></div>
