# Inner Compass

<div class="aphorism-text">

The human journey is in three stages: the first is birth, the second is growth in consciousness towards awakening, and the third is the journey of the soul after death.

<div class="div"></div>

To find your way more easily in your earthly journey you need to refer to your inner spiritual compass.

<div class="div"></div>

An appropriate prescription may lead to a clear understanding and acceptance of a situation. Your life on earth is like being in a waiting room expecting to be called to your destination of pure consciousness.

The master said, "It is not what I have that attracts you to me, it is more what I don't have: I don't have the concerns, fears and desires you all have."

<div class="div"></div>

You may read the situation more clearly after you lose your ambitions and other illusions. 

<div class="div"></div>

An event or story is complete only when it ends.

<div class="div"></div>

The personal life of the seeker of truth is enhanced by remembering death.

<div class="div"></div>

Most of us will naturally experience loneliness until we fully embrace our inner soul.

<div class="div"></div>

Loneliness is a primal desire to be at one with the soul, the real union.

<div class="div"></div>

You are fortunate if you reach a point where you really don't know who you are, with your mind and intellect intact.

<div class="div"></div>

Whenever you think you have some extra space or time, they often get filled with waste material.

<div class="div"></div>

If you believe in a supreme and just God, then you accept whatever has affected you as it could only happen with God's approval.

<div class="div"></div>

Self-image, self-esteem, and prestige are important for the young but can be an obstacle and handicap for mature seekers of truth.

<div class="div"></div>

The ultimate spiritual challenge is to transcend the mind and realise that two plus two is still one.
