# Service

<div class="aphorism-text">

To serve unconditionally is to liberate yourself from the calculating mind and ego.  

<div class="div"></div>

Experience of the greater lights of heart and soul can bring relief from mental attachments, desires and false hopes. Human suffering can be a prelude to the gift of spiritual offerings.  

<div class="div"></div>

Our quest to know and understand Reality stems from our souls. The pattern and plan is well in place and our role is simply to follow the design. Enjoy Grace. 

<div class="div"></div>

Divine love is the cosmic energy field that permeates the whole universe and manifests as the human soul within the heart — proof of God’s love. 

<div class="div"></div>

You may get what you longed and dreamt for, but the next desire and hope may negate everything before.

<div class="div"></div>

Celebrate achievement and certainty, but accept cheerfully the nature of our wordly experience with its constant uncertainty.

<div class="div"></div>

We are all spiritual beings subjected to earthly experiences for a short duration.  

<div class="div"></div>

Perfect action is to place an idea or a thing in the right place at the right time.
