# Duality

<div class="aphorism-text">

All deception or falsehood contains a spark of truth.

<div class="div"></div>

We live in a world of duality with one aspect stronger than the other, which requires discernment. The worst poison is sometimes a remedy. Use head and heart to gain wisdom and a good outcome.  

<div class="div"></div>

When our sensory world and mind cannot tackle or resolve an issue, leave it, and sublimate. Beyond the elusive solution lies a new resolution.  

<div class="div"></div>

The mind and intellect explores the limits of experience. We want the limitless zone of Oneness upon which everything depends.  

<div class="div"></div>

Human identity forever seeks sacred reality within the creational limitations of space and time. Sacred places are reminders of the nature of our own soul.  

<div class="div"></div>

Our love for winning or receiving gifts or favours echoes the heavenly gift of the soul - the ultimate treasure; given with grace and unconditional love.  

<div class="div"></div>

The human desire for miracles is a thread in the tapestry of life. The ultimate thrill is to know and experience that state of infinitude. That is the quantum shift and thrill.
