# Life Continued

<div class="aphorism-text">

The natural universe is not silent or noisy. It is in perfect turmoil and cycles of interaction between matter and energies - self-organising.

<div class="div"></div>

Plants are rooted in earth and nourished by air, sun and sky: they are both earthly and heavenly, as are all living creatures.  

<div class="div"></div>

Intelligence facilitates the continuation of consciousness.  

<div class="div"></div>

The full meaning and challenge of life is revealed through reflection and meditation.

<div class="div"></div>

Your perspective on life and your values will change radically if you only have an hour to live.

<div class="div"></div>

Living creatures love life and fear death. Few humans discover that the true nature of life itself is eternal.  

<div class="div"></div>

Every living creature is obsessed with life and its preservation.  

<div class="div"></div>

The body is alive due to the unconditional love of the soul, which connects it to life's source.

<div class="div"></div>
