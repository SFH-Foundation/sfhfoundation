# Victory of Oneness

<div class="aphorism-text">

Failure and success are the dualities that challenge our humanity. Victory belongs to our soul and the world of spirits.  

<div class="div"></div>

A fresh thought arises from a still mind. Both visibly and invisibly, life arises from what we call dead or inert.  

<div class="div"></div>

Outward togetherness does not imply inner gatheredness. What appears on the surface as pleasant conduct may hide deep discord and repulsion.  

<div class="div"></div>

When a setback is seen through the lens of the soul, it can be perceived as an opportunity to return to the ascent towards the Truth.  

<div class="div"></div>

Disappointments will continue until you reach the real appointment - Truth.
