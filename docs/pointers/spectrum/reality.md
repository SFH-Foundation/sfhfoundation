# Reality

<div class="aphorism-text">

God decides everything without being affected by anything and that decision incorporates the hopes and wills of all living creatures.

<div class="div"></div>

All of creation is driven by the Truth, God, or the Divine Creator towards its glorious immensity.

<div class="div"></div>

Truth is ever-constant and ever-present, irrespective of our embracing or denouncing it.

<div class="div"></div>

Truth and reality are ever-constant and permanent. Everything that exists and all experiences are temporary, but carry within them a spark of the permanent truth.

<div class="div"></div>

Wherever you look Truth beams. Like looking at direct sunlight you don't see anything unless you reduce the light's intensity - we only understand when there is both truth and some falsehood.

<div class="div"></div>

Truth and reality have no end as they are not confined to space and time (whereas) falsehood and illusion will always come to an end.

<div class="div"></div>

When the sun of truth appears in your sky all the millions of stars fade away. When cosmic reality shines all other values and ideas vanish.

<div class="div"></div>

Truth is experienced when all other notions, ideas or thoughts have ended. 

<div class="div"></div>

Progress towards the Real begins by recognizing what is not real.

<div class="div"></div>

To touch the boundary of Reality you need to leave the experience of duality.

<div class="div"></div>

On earth, there is no absolute freedom. In heavens, there is no freedom or lack of it.

<div class="div"></div>

All our experiences and discoveries are steps towards the ultimate reality and Truth.

<div class="div"></div>

Changing identity and crisis in life may be preludes to experiencing Reality.

<div class="div"></div>

Every instant is real in its connection to the Ever-real.

<div class="div"></div>

The greatest discovery is that Truth is the only True Reality and the greatest victory is to be at one with Truth.

<div class="div"></div>

The cosmic reality is perpetual and constant - from it, all varieties, temporary and virtual appearances emanate and then vanish back to it.

<div class="div"></div>

God's house has no doors or walls. It is the boundless universe.

<div class="div"></div>
