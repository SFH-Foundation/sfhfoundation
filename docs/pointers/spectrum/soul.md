# Soul   

<div class="aphorism-text">

It is only through the light of our soul that we are content beyond qualities and quantities, otherwise nothing is ever enough.  

<div class="div"></div>

Nature only reveals a minute amount of what is concealed. We cannot bear the immense range of the realities of nature via our mind, only the soul can.  

<div class="div"></div>

The soul is in charge and governs the human being and its shadow is the self which desires to dominate.  

<div class="div"></div>

Your soul gives life and energy to yourself; and when you realise this Reality then your emotional intelligence will be set alight.

<div class="div"></div>

The soul has neither fear nor sorrow; the mind is the seat of these emotions, which can be helpful for survival but handicaps for arrival. 

<div class="div"></div>

To live as a soul, the animal self needs to be held within bounds; and then to transcend sensory experiences to the abode of perfect Grace.  

<div class="div"></div>

The real you is ever present as your soul and to realise that and live it you need to transcend all and enter the zone of the soul's presence.
