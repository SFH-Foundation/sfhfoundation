# Consciousness, Connectivity, and Continuity

<div class="aphorism-text">

Every living creature is driven to connect with what is relevant for survival and continuity to experience life.

<div class="div"></div>

Whatever exists is never absolutely clear or constant, but it has a touch of truth.  

<div class="div"></div>

What is experienced as real and true is a glimpse of what is absolutely real and true.

<div class="div"></div>

Everything expresses its state in numerous ways, but the mind's natural concern for survival filters out most of these messages.

<div class="div"></div>

Body, mind and emotions are the earthly faculties that connect with our heavenly origin of light - the soul.

<div class="div"></div>

Body, mind and self are transitions in consciousness, energised by the soul and supreme consciousness.

<div class="div"></div>

Reason and rationality are like ladders that lead to the zone of pure consciousness that is the source of life and all mental and sensory experiences.

<div class="div"></div>

All constants, including scientific ones, are also relative but less than others.

<div class="div"></div>

If the earth is one year old, then humanity is twenty seconds old and the West rules for two seconds - reflect on this perspective.
