# Aphorisms from "Spectrum of Reality"

This page is organised into separate "journeys", made up of small groups of aphorisms. Each saying is, in itself, a key to wisdon and deeper understanding, so the intention is that you travel through each journey separately and return to this page numerous times as each stage takes you deeper into your experience, into your own heart. We know that the nature of digital media can lead one to thoughtless consumption, so take your time here, read and reflect on each aphorism for an extended period and come back tomorrow again. This site isn't going anywhere...

## Journey 10 - Differentiated Sameness

## Journey 15 - Happiness and Content  

"We strive for happiness through plans, efforts and desires - all of which preclude and exclude it."  

"No one is really happy with where they are. Happiness cannot be bound to a situation for it is the child of total freedom."
