# Journey 12 - Service

To serve unconditionally is to liberate yourself from the calculating mind and ego.  

Experience of the greater lights of heart and soul can bring relief from mental attachments, desires and false hopes. Human suffering can be a prelude to the gift of spiritual offerings.  

Our quest to know and understand Reality stems from our souls. The pattern and plan is well in place and our role is simply to follow the design. Enjoy Grace.  

Divine love is the cosmic energy field that permeates the whole universe and manifests as the human soul within the heart — proof of God’s love.  

We are all spiritual beings subjected to earthly experiences for a short duration.  

Perfect action is to place an idea or a thing in the right place at the right time.
