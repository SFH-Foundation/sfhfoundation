"We are impressionable creatures and need outer references until we can access our own inner soul - the resident teacher."  

"We want guidance that shows us the truth within our own heart. We need commitment and consistency along the path so the self yields to its root and origin - the inner soul."  

"The desire to excel in the world and to experience acknowledgment is an echo of the greatness and superiority of the nature of our own soul."  

"The beginnerâ€™s mind is fresh, flexible, and close to the door of eternal presence and the infinite Nowness."  

"To mimic the stroke of a golf champion can be helpful, but to mimic a sage may be a dangerous distraction. Love, follow, and be transformed."  

"Appropriateness implies clear intention, appropriate action and full presence in the moment - preludes for spiritual awakening."
