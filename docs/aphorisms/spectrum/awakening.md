"The awakened person looks at situations and events through higher consciousness. Clear witnessing ends regrets and confusions."  

"The highest level of morality is to respond to the voice of truth, as it emanates from the pure heart."  

"Like knowledge, love is a force that leads to the original source of existence - Oneness."  

"Human life is due to the light that is emitted from the sacred soul within the heart. That is the Lord within."  

"The fulfilled authentic being experiences splendid presence whilst journeying in a changing world. Your soul has filled you up."  

"The end is where the beginning was: ever constant and present. Supreme consciousness, or God, is the master designer and governor of all."
