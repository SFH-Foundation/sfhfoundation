# Journey 9 - Truth and Light

"Our desire for truth, justice and fairness is a beam of light that emanates from Oneness and pervades the universe - from where all has emanated."  

"Anything that moves and changes is subject to the limitations of space and time and has a temporary reality. The Real is ever constant."  

"So long as you discriminate, you are looking through the shadows and not the original light."  

"Wisdom is a spectrum - at one end it has to do with rationality and good guidance, and at the other end it is pure, infinite light."  

"Wisdom is of many levels and, like light, can illuminate and guide, or dazzle and confuse."   

"Disappointments will continue until you reach the real appointment - Truth."
