# Journey 4 - Victory and Gatheredness

Failure and success are the dualities that challenge our humanity. Victory belongs to our soul and the world of spirits.  

A fresh thought arises from a still mind. Both visibly and invisibly, life arises from what we call dead or inert.  

Outward togetherness does not imply inner gatheredness. What appears on the surface as pleasant conduct may hide deep discord and repulsion.  

When a setback is seen through the lens of the soul, it can be perceived as an opportunity to return to the ascent towards the Truth.
