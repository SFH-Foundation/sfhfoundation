"Your heart is really safe when you hear without ears and see without eyes."  

"Our earthly journey is temporary and futile, unless it leads to the unison between head and heart. That state leads to soul consciousness."  

"Most common folk look for the price of things but are ignorant about the treasure and joy within the heart."  

"Looking for a soulmate is an outer drive energized by your own soul within you - the everpresent soulmate."  

"To miss someone is a reminder of missing the One - your own soul."  

"A peaceful heart is at rest with passionate adoration and beyond all competition or cooperation."  

"Every moment brings about a new uncertainty and the tranquil heart is content with that reality."
