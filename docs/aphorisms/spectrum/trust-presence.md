# Journey 6 - Trust and Presence

Trust in Godâ€™s perfection is to face the next moment with cheerful acceptance.  

Presence is when form and meaning connects.  

Fear of loneliness is one of the numerous fears of the ego until it unifies with its soul, which is ever constant in its universe of oneness.  

The outer world is perceived through the lens of our inner state.  

To experience the light of truth, turn away from the shadows of falsehood.  

Justice prevails when otherness and differences submerge into oneness and sameness.
