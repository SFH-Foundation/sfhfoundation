# Journey 14 - Purpose

![](../../assets/images/03.jpg)

"The purpose of human life is to experience existence through the lens of Oneness without denying the temporary experience of pluralities."  

"We desire a life that increases in its knowledge, contentment and happiness and that state relates to the soul’s nature — God’s will."  

"Every movement and action declares its purpose. Ultimately, spiritual stillness implies access to higher consciousness that is beyond drives and needs."  

"To experience the boundless eternal zone of consciousness - the soul's essence - we need to transcend all our human states."  

"We occasionally experience the perfect moment - no thought, intention or action. That instant reveals our soul's perfect state."  

"Whatever exists has an aspect of the sacred."
