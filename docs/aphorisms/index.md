"Life cannot be understood unless one is willing to die."

"There is nothing new in the path of arrival."

"To restrict the self is the first step towards the open horizons of the soul."

"To live the moment fully, you must go beyond space-time."

"Infinity is rooted in the tiny entity of an electron or photon."

"You cannot say, ‘I fooled them’. You have only fooled yourself. There is nothing other than yourself."
