This conversation will address a wide spectrum of key issues of global importance, like stress, violence, fear, hope, peace, human rights. What are we seeking? What is death? Why don't we celebrate death? The stress resulting from the material world we live in, the moral dilemmas we face on a day-to-day basis, the polarization in society and the creation of the other, and - most importantly - the lack of respect for the Earth and its creatures.
