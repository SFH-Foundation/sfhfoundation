## Background

Amir had requested Shaykh Fadhlalla to participate in a series of interviews as part of his PhD entitled 'Living Transcendence: A Phenomenological Study of Spiritual Exemplars'.
 
This pioneering study focuses on the lived experience of Spiritual Exemplars such as Shaykh Fadhlalla, who are perceived by others as self-transcendent, or to be God-realized, or to have surrendered within their religious or spiritual path.

Amir is the Co-Founder of the Israeli Education & Spirit Movement founded in 2009. Amir left medical school at the end of the 5th year of his studies to seek answers to life's questions. He then spent 2 years in a Zen monastery in Japan and over 20 years in a spiritual community in the USA. He has co-published two books connecting education and philosophical-spiritual inquiry; and recently published _Spiritual Transmission: Paradoxes and Dilemmas on the Spiritual Path_.
