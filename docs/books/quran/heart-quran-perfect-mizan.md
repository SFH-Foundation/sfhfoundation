## Summary

Surat Yā Sīn is the heart of the Qur’an. It is the chapter of the Qur’an which is read over the dead, therefore it is a chapter of great importance to the living. Should one seek to know the meaning of life, one must experience death, for man has come from the non-physical realm and he is swiftly proceeding towards it again. Surat YaSin is also about the Prophet Muhammad and it is addresses directly to the bearers of the unitary message who continue to carry out the message.
