## Summary

The Qur’an is the foundation of the “Deen” (life-transaction), containing as it does Allah’s ways, patterns, purpose and direction of creation. The purpose of this collection is to make the Qur’an accessible, with easy reference to key issues concerning life and the path of Islam. By emphasizing the vital and transformative teachings of the “Deen”, this work offers the serious student the opportunity to awaken to the timeless message of the Truth. Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri is dedicated to making available the original Islamic ‘prescription for life’, and hopes that this selection of the Qur’anic verses will be a useful exposure for Muslims and seekers of Allah in their journey towards illumination and the realization of the Ever-Presence of Allah.
