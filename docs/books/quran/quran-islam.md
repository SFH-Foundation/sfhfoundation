## Summary

 \`Allamah Sayyid M. H. Tabataba`i shows in this gem how the Qur'an contains the fundamental roots of Islam and the proof of prophethood as the Word of God. Copious quotations from the Qur'an are given to illustrate its teachings, its exoteric and esoteric dimensions and the meaning of exegesis.

> "The Qur'an in Islam should be read now more than ever before because the current aberrations propagated in the name of Islam in general and Shi\`ism in particular necessitate the uncompromising and clear statement of the traditional Islamic perspective as expounded by such masters as \`Allamah Tabataba`i. Moreover, the present book marks an important addition to the literature in English on the central theophany of Islam, the Noble Qur'an."

-- From the Foreword by Seyyed Hossein Nasr
