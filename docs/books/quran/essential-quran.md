## Reader Review

_By Nazo Hadi_

I am a born Muslim and was exposed to the Qur'an from an early age, but I was never satisfied with the commentaries I read.

The Qur'an seemed to talk about events in the past, but I wanted to know how it relates to my life in this time and age.

In most commentaries the commentators follow the chapters and verses. In this book, Shaykh Fadhlalla has chosen topics which are important to everyday life and selected and collected all the verses relevant to those topics in the appendix at the end of the book, I found this approach very helpful when I wanted to look up what the Qur'an says about a certain topic.

The central theme of the Qur'an is its emphasis on Allah/God as the One source and Essence that permeates the entire universe. All manifestations come from Allah, are sustained by Him and return to Him. The entire universe is in submission to Allah.

According to the Qur'an our job is to groom the ego and adhere to His laws and regulations so that we become aware of the Divine Presence at all times.

This book is useful for serious Muslims and anyone who is interested to know the basic message of the Qur'an. It is a very good introduction for beginners and inspires one to read and have a better understanding of the Qur'an.

It has led me to listen to the Shaykh's other commentaries on his website and has transformed my life.

For example, his commentary on _Surah Al-Imran_ -- 3: 179 -- to accept the present and trust in Allah for the future has helped me to deal with a lot of worry and anxiety in my life and given me peace of mind.

In addition it has changed my relationship with the Qur'an so that now I actually enjoy reading it.
