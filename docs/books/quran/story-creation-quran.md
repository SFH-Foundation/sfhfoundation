## Summary

This book is an exposition of the Qur’anic verses relating to the nature of physical phenomena, including the origins of the universe, the nature of light, matter, space and time, and the evolution of biological and sentient beings. In this book Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri demonstrates that the verses in the Qur’an relating to the outer physical phenomena are not separate from inner phenomena and states, but in fact reflect them.
