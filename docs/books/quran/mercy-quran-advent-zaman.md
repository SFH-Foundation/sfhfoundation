## Summary

This book looks to the eternal garden of Qur’an through an existential angle, seeking guidance and direction for safe conduct in this life. It does not follow the traditional tafsirs, for its attempt is to seek from the Qur’an the knowledge of a way of living that will enable man, here and now, during this short lifetime, to travel courageously, purposefully and humbly toward his noble destiny, his Creator.
