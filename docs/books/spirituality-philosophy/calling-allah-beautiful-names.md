## Summary

The primal design of human beings is based on an intrinsic knowledge of perfection and its yearning and journeying towards it. Life’s experience is based on polarities and opposites, all of which is founded on a zone of constancy that does not change. All needs and desires are drives toward the perfection of the highest. The intelligent human being has no choice other than calling on Allah, whose Most Beautiful Names and Attributes are perfect at all times. It is by that calling and worship that we achieve the fruits of existence.

>“In this book, we have presented a brief discourse on the doors of entry into the vast, boundless divine light created through supplication and calling upon Allah. Our hope is to facilitate its use, benefit and transformation for the traveler along the path. Thus, the repeated reading and use of this book by the seeker is recommended to open up the numerous horizons and subtleties of Allah’s ways of grace.”
