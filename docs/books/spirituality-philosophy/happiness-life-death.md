## Summary

In _Happiness in Life and After Death_, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri provides a lucid and inspiring account of life, death and the hereafter, according to an Islamic Sufi perspective.

The book opens with a wide-ranging sweep of death and dying as viewed in other cultures and religions — from ancient Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Zoroastrian sources through to Judaism and Christianity.

Based on the Qur’an and Prophetic Message, this book offers a splendid collection of revelations and spiritual teachings that map a basic path towards a wholesome way of living without forgetting death – constant awareness of one’s intimate dual nature takes away much of the fear of death and makes it seem more like a familiar companion.
