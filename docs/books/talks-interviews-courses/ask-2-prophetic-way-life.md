## Summary

This book consists of all 12 lessons of the Academy of Self Knowledge's Course TWO -- The Prophetic Revealed Path. It has been renamed to The Prophetic Way of Life.

After discovering the map of the self, we learn here how the code of ethics that govern religious practice and the Prophetic way are in fact transformational tools to enlightened awakening. Based on the cosmology/view that the heart is the connecting point between the soul (the eternal), and the self (the ephemeral), the course focuses on transformation through awareness and following the practices of the Prophetic path.

This way of transformation includes being accountable and responsible while being continually aware of the soul and higher consciousness. We learn that we must continually strive for perfection but with the knowledge that no one attains such perfection in an enduring way and that it is God's perfect attributes that permeate all of existence and bind, unify and drive creation towards fulfillment.

The objective of this course is to enable the seeker to love the One unconditionally and deal with multiplicity rationally.
