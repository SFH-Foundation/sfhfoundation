## Summary

This book is a transcript of a 1990 conversation with Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, in which he talks about wide-ranging topics, is as relevant today as it was when it was first conducted, for it presents Islam as the archetypal, universal, Adamic path that began when humanity rose in consciousness to recognize duality and began its journey from the relative back to Absolute Unity.
