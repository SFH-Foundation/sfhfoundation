# Talks, Interviews, and Courses

This collection offers an original and refreshing views of Islam and its lived reality in the modern world today. Using Prophetic and Qurâ€™anic teachings as foundational references, the essence of true Islam is communicated in a transmittive manner which allows the reader to embrace its message in a pristine light, unencumbered by veils of culture.

In our current times, when nations and communities are increasingly subject to divisive and polarizing forces, suspicion, misunderstanding and misinformation abound. This collection explains the unifying path of Islam, its history and development as a religion, the distinction between original and primordial Islam and the acculturated traditions of Muslims, the life that Muslims lead today and also the future of Islam in a world characterized by globalizing tendencies, migration and paradigmatic shifts in how we find meaning and purpose. The courses lead the reader in stages through a process of self-transformation that will centre the in the unity that underlies the experience of existence.
