## Summary

This book is a transcription of extensive interviews between Professor Ali A. Allawi and Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, conducted in South Africa during January - February of 2014. In them, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri talks about his life story and the spiritual journey that he embarked on and the path he has been on ever since.

Professor Allawi's questions highlight Shaykh Haeri's life-changing encounters with Sufi Masters and other spiritual teachers and his travels and teaching with Sufi communities.

Drawing out Shaykh Haeri's far-reaching views on the future of religion, Sufi orders and global spirituality, the conversations probe deeply into how one attains enlightenment and what it means to live in the light of the Absolute in a relative world.

Deeply engaging and inspiring for any serious seeker, these interviews were transcribed by Julia Khadija Lafene and edited by Anjum Jaleel. In order to publish it as a book, chapter headings, subheadings and footnotes have been added, many gaps within the conversations have been filled, and footnotes and a glossary have been added.
