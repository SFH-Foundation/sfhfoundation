## Summary

This collection of verses from the Qur’an and traditions from the Prophet Muhammad (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family) and the Imams is unique for it makes available for the first time in English a comprehensive selection of Islamic teachings arranged according to topics that deal with belief and worship as well as the social and spiritual values which Islam upholds.

“Prophetic Traditions in Islam – On the Authority of the Family of the Prophet” contains a wealth of wisdom, knowledge and inspiration for all who seek to know more about Islam and the process of refining one’s character and conduct. Taking as its source the gnosis and science transmitted by Allah on the tongue of the Prophet Muhammad, it presents fundamentals of the legal parameters and spiritual truths of Islam.

From this book one can learn a great deal about the Islamic conception of God and prophecy, of worship and virtue, of the character of the Shi`ah Imams and even of early Islamic history. Furthermore, one can also learn much about the human state, its origin and end, and the meaning of terrestrial existence and our role here on earth. The book therefore addresses itself not only to the lovers of the Ahl al-Bayt and all Muslims, but in fact to all human beings, whatever their background may be, as long as they are attracted to the world of the Spirit and are in quest of meaning in their transient lives here on earth.
