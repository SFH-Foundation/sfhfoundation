“Prophetic Traditions in Islam – On the Authority of the Family of the Prophet” contains a wealth of wisdom, knowledge and inspiration for all who seek to know more about Islam and the process of refining one’s character and conduct.

Furthermore, one can also learn much about the human state, its origin and end, and the meaning of terrestrial existence and our role here on earth. The book therefore addresses itself not only to the lovers of the Ahl al-Bayt and all Muslims, but in fact to all human beings, whatever their background may be, as long as they are attracted to the world of the Spirit and are in quest of meaning in their transient lives here on earth.
