Zahra Publications has been publishing books on Islam and Sufism since 1981. Dedicated to disseminating the original teachings of Islam through contemporary and classical works alike, Zahra Publications titles lay particular emphasis on spiritual and transformative teachings.

Islam reflects the constant compassion and presence of the Divine Light. In these crucial times, more than ever before, Muslims and seekers of a life lived with integrity and harmony need to renew their knowledge and awaken to the original Prophetic path.
