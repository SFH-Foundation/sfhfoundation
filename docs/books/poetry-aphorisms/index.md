# Poetry and Aphorisms

Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri’s poetry capture in brush strokes the human condition and our aspirations to connect to a harmonizing sense of who we are. These short poems remind us of the unity that underlies all existence. The books of aphorisms are designed to act as catalysts for contemplation and reflection; as such they are often dense and pithy reminders of sometimes obvious truisms that govern our lives, and at other times, the more hidden nature of how the diversity of human experience points to God’s unity.
