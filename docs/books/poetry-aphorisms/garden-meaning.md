## Summary 

Human love for beauty, harmony and gardens simply reflects our desire to connect forms, emotions and meanings. Energy and matter are inseparable, so are all beginnings and end. ʻThe Garden of Meaningʼ expresses the truth of the ever present Origin of all dualities, pluralities and diversities. Any reflection that elevates the human mind towards higher consciousness is a spiritual exercise. The pointers in this book are like ladders to help the serious reader transcend the limitations of the natural trap of space and time.
