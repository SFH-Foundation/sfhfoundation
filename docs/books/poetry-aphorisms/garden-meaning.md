## Summary 

Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri grew up in an environment where religious scholars, as well as sufis and mystics, were part of his formative experiences. His love and understanding of the Qur'an with its universality made him respect other religions and spiritual paths. His faith and trust in the sacred cosmic governance of the universe led him to realise how all dualities and whatever is within space and time are inseparable from the unitive force that prevails throughout the cosmos.

Human love for beauty, harmony and gardens simply reflects our desire to connect forms, emotions and meanings. Energy and matter are inseparable, so are all beginnings and end. ʻThe Garden of Meaningʼ expresses the truth of the ever present Origin of all dualities, pluralities and diversities. Any reflection that elevates the human mind towards higher consciousness is a spiritual exercise. The pointers in this book are like ladders to help the serious reader transcend the limitations of the natural trap of space and time.
