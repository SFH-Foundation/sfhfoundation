## Summary

_Beyond Windows_ offers moving and profound insights into the thoughts and murmurings of the eminent Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, whose touching compassion and giving spirituality shines through every poem in this anthology of concinnity between the slave-self and the Eternal Lord.

The collection is a finely woven quilt of deep expression in which the yearning of the soul's quest to live (and die) in the aura and divine sheen of the Creator permeates every line and stanza, bringing the reader closer to that soul's striving for spiritual relevance and meaning.

These poems are a portal to an essentially private spiritual journey, beyond the windows of our ordinary, erroneous perceptions of the self â€“- yet they bind us and take us along to this erudite sage's deep thirst for the Love, Mercy and Presence of our Inimitable and infinite Lord.
