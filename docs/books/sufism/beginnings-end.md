## Summary

_Beginning's End_ is a contemporary outlook on the Sufi sciences of self-knowledge, intended for Muslims and non-Muslims alike. The author holds that truth has no end and is eternal, and that is why human beings will seek total freedom, of which material freedom is only a small part. The final freedom is a natural, spontaneous submission and being connected to timelessness, yet experiencing time.

> "This book was written mainly to highlight the truth that if you wish to nourish the heart and nurture the light within, you need to make structural adjustments to your way of life as well as the all-consuming material drive. The book is a challenge to our modern lifestyle that is out of balance.

> Now it is being reprinted as the gap widens between the sustainable inner happiness and the ever-lasting outer frenzy." 

-- from the Preface to the Reprinted Edition.
