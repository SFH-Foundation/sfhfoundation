## Summary

Leaves From A Sufi Journal is a unique collection of articles presenting an outstanding introduction to the areas of Sufism and original Islamic teachings.

This ageless wisdom is set against the backcloth of a changing world in which the application of this knowledge to one's own life could scarcely be more appropriate.

Written by both classical and contemporary writers, this compilation includes commentaries on the Qur'anic revelations; the mysteries of faith; inner and outer practices; the lives of prophets and saints; the individual, the family and society and the nature of unity and existence.
