## Summary

> “There can be no doubt that there is only one message in man’s heart, to be fulfilled, to live a life that is honorable and fearless, that has within it no darkness, ignorance or abuse.”

This book is based on a collection of talks which were given in the eighties in the United States. The sixties and seventies witnessed resurgences in various spheres of mysticism, spirituality and related endeavors or topics, including the manifestation of formal prescriptive Islam in various forms. The reactions were both positive and negative, causing many people to begin to awaken to a better understanding of this ever vibrant faith, the last revealed of the world’s great religions.
