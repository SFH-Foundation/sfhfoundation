## Summary

> “There can be no doubt that there is only one message in man’s heart, to be fulfilled, to live a life that is honorable and fearless, that has within it no darkness, ignorance or abuse.”

This book is based on a collection of talks which were given in the eighties in the United States. The sixties and seventies witnessed resurgences in various spheres of mysticism, spirituality and related endeavors or topics, including the manifestation of formal prescriptive Islam in various forms. The reactions were both positive and negative, causing many people to begin to awaken to a better understanding of this ever vibrant faith, the last revealed of the world’s great religions.

## Reader Review

_By Sadiqa_

"We will not understand the world unless we understand the individual..We will not make headway unless we understand the 'I'..."

Based on a series of talks given in the 80s, The Sufi Way to Self-Unfoldment is, more than ever, relevant to our times when more and more of us question the purpose of life and values that go beyond materialism.

Over the years, the book's timeless and universal message has appealed to seekers world wide and has been an inspiration and revelation for many, including myself. I was interested in Islam but found I was unable to 'connect' with what I felt to be a cultural view. I was given The Sufi Way to Self-Unfoldment in its pre-published format - Self Knowledge.

The book made complete sense to me. I carried it around for years, highlighted it, wondering who the author was. This was before the days of ISBN. I was even teaching Muslim friends from the book, which made absolute sense.

Then - by 'coincidence' - I met the author's wife, who gifted me a copy of a book just published by her husband. It was _The Sufi Way to Self-Unfoldment_. Shaykh Fadhlalla emphasises the absolute need for self-knowledge as an essential tool for a committed seeker. A simple description is given of all aspects of the self and "our ultimate purpose in life: to get rid of the 'I'.

The book is a must, both for Muslims needing more in-depth explanation of the inner meanings of their rituals, and for non-Muslims, needing clarification of Islamic practices and their ultimate purpose.

A short book, _The Sufi Way to Self-Unfoldment_ can be read in an evening, and re-read for life. I still have my battered copy - bound together with sellotape. It was instrumental to a profound understanding of the Sufi Islamic teachings. I will never throw it away.
