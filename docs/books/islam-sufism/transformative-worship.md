This book bridges the traditional practices and beliefs, culture and language of Islam with the transformative spiritual states described by the Sufis and Gnostics. Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri shows how the worship of Islam can transform insight and perception of Reality, and presents profound guidance for those who journey through the path of Islamic belief and practice. He draws from the Noble Qur’an, the Prophet’s traditions, narrations from the Ahl al-Bayt and seminal works from Sufi masters and scholars.
