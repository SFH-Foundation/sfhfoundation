## Summary

For the serious seeker of Reality, the way to transcendent knowledge has been clearly indicated by the Prophet: "Whoever knows himself, knows his Lord". Coming to know the inner landscape of the human self is one of the essential foundations for progress on the path of knowledge.

This book is a practical and accessible distillation of the tawhidi (unitive) Islamic teachings and insights into the map of the human self. Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri has sought to furnish the reader with the fundamental elements and insights into the make-up of the individual self and how the various elements of spirituality and humanity interact within us.
