# ASK

Now more than ever is a time to transform our consciousness. The Academy  of Self Knowledge delivers a range of dynamic courses, workshops and seminars in the journey of self-discovery.

Universal, soul- stirring questions are addressed, such as: What is happiness? Does my life have a purpose? How can I find harmony in my relationships? What does it mean to be in connection with my soul? Is it possible to live joyfully in today’s world?

Founded in 2003 by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, ASK offers key principles which give us an insight into who we truly are, what motivates us and what hinders us from living our best life. Once we have been given these maps of the self, the challenge then lies in how to lead our lives in an optimal way that supports our growing consciousness. We are often aware of the desire to maintain our spiritual values, but find it difficult to navigate our way in a world that feels challenging. Unlike most courses, the ASK program not only gives you the knowledge base but also realistic applications by which you will experience real transformation in your life, building on the premise that knowledge alone is not power, but that applied knowledge has the power to transform.

## What ASK offers

> We offer "maps of truth that will illumine the journey in this life and the hereafter".

The Academy has developed bespoke packages of learning that meet the requirements of specific groups and organizational needs. Currently we regularly run two types of intensive courses, either over a few months or over full weekend workshops. Both of these are highly participative, interactive and self-reflective to deepen one’s understanding of our own real life experiences.
