# Cosmology of the Self

This course addresses the question of ‘Who am I?’ in the fullness of being human as both physical and spiritual, in body and spirit. It offers practical maps of the journey of life in this world and the next. This knowledge of the self also echoes the teachings of the spiritual traditions of the world’s religions. Its essential premise is that humanity is one, and that all humanity is linked by the one divine essence, which is the same in all human beings, irrespective of race, religion, heredity and culture, and the limits of time and space.

In this course we will present pivotal cycles of life experience before birth right through the arc of human development towards the twilight years and the next phase of life. Topics explored are:

1. early childhood and the development of consciousness
2. ethics and acquiring desirable character traits
3. body-mind-spirit
4. relationships
5. free will and predestination
6. ageing and wisdom,
7. witnessing perfection
8. realizing one’s potential
9. enlightenment and the next life
