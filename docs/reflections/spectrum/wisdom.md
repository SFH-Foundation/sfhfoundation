# Wisdom

<div class="aphorism-text">

Wisdom is about context, relevance, balance - appropriateness in time and place.

<div class="div"></div>

Wisdom starts with useful knowledge and leads to beyond all differentiation and earthly values.

<div class="div"></div>

Even the greatest lie contains a spark of truth.

<div class="div"></div>

Wisdom is a spectrum - at one end it has to do with rationality and good guidance, and at the other end it is pure, infinite light.  

<div class="div"></div>

Wisdom is of many levels and, like light, can illuminate and guide, or dazzle and confuse. 

<div class="div"></div>

Acting upon little wisdom is better than accumulating unused knowledge.

<div class="div"></div>

Wisdom, discernment and insights are a prelude to experiencing the ever-present conclusion: sacred presence beyond mind, sight, or self.

<div class="div"></div>

What we can measure and describe is only an aspect of what is immeasurable, defies definition, and is beyond mental comprehension.
