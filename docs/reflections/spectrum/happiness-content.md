# Happiness and Content 

<div class="aphorism-text">

We strive for happiness through plans, efforts and desires - all of which preclude and exclude it.  

<div class="div"></div>

No one is really happy with where they are. Happiness cannot be bound to a situation for it is the child of total freedom.  

<div class="div"></div>

You are either in happiness and thus oblivious to everything else, or you remember and relate to that state.  

<div class="div"></div>

Leisure and pleasure may often lead to degrading consciousness, unless there is conscious effort to transcend mind and the senses.

<div class="div"></div>

Happiness implies mindfulness and loss of sense of time and place.  

<div class="div"></div>

Happiness is a state of sheer being and not becoming. It doesnâ€™t relate to past or future - it is totally in the **now**.
