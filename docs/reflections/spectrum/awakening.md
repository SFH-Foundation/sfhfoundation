# Awakening

<div class="aphorism-text">

The awakened person looks at situations and events through higher consciousness. Clear witnessing ends regrets and confusions. 

<div class="div"></div>

The highest level of morality is to respond to the voice of truth, as it emanates from the pure heart.  

<div class="div"></div>

Like knowledge, love is a force that leads to the original source of existence - Oneness.  

<div class="div"></div>

Human life is due to the light that is emitted from the sacred soul within the heart. That is the Lord within.  

<div class="div"></div>

The fulfilled authentic being experiences splendid presence whilst journeying in a changing world. Your soul has filled you up.  

<div class="div"></div>

You always hope to find someone you can totally rely upon, to love and die for, that is your own soul.

<div class="div"></div>

The end is where the beginning was: ever constant and present. Supreme consciousness, or God, is the master designer and governor of all.
