# Destiny

The best destiny is to be with eternal Oneness.

Human consciousness is temporay, limited and conditioned, whereas its origin and destiny are eternal, pure consciousness.

Destiny and origin are twins that reside in timeless infinity.

Destiny is perfect irrespective or personal judgement and experience.

Real acceptance of the moment enables you to flow with ease along your destiny.

Pain prolongs time. What makes distance long is strong emotion and the need to get to your destiny.
