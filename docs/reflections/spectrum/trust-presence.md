# Journey 6 - Trust and Presence

<div class="aphorism-text">

Trust in Godâ€™s perfection is to face the next moment with cheerful acceptance.  

<div class="div"></div>

Presence is when form and meaning connects.  

<div class="div"></div>

Fear of loneliness is one of the numerous fears of the ego until it unifies with its soul, which is ever constant in its universe of oneness. 

<div class="div"></div>

Truth is eternal and a lie only lives briefly as allowed by Truth.

<div class="div"></div>

The outer world is perceived through the lens of our inner state.  

<div class="div"></div>

To experience the light of truth, turn away from the shadows of falsehood.  

<div class="div"></div>

Justice prevails when otherness and differences submerge into oneness and sameness.
