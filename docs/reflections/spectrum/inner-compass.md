# Inner Compass

The human journey is in three stages: the first is birth, the second is growth in consciousness towards awakening, and the third is the journey of the soul after death. 

To find your way more easily in your earthly journey you need to refer to your inner spiritual compass.

An appropriate prescription may lead to a clear understanding and acceptance of a situation. Your life on earth is like being in a waiting room expecting to be called to your destination of pure consciousness.

The drive towards excellence and perfection is a primary force in us, reflecting the perfect soul within.

It is a natural drive to be in pursuit of real identity and purpose of life.

An important social drive is to be useful, accepted, and acknowledged by others. 

The master said, "It is not what I have that attracts you to me, it is more what I don't have: I don't have the concerns, fears and desires you all have."

No person can help you realise the truth, but may be helpful to remove some falsehood and ignorance. Truth reveals itself by itself when the recipient is ready.

You always hope to find someone you can totally rely upon, to love and die for, that is your own soul.

To see one object clearly you need two eyes. To realise truth, you also need one clear head and a pure, unattached heart.

You may read the situation more clearly after you lose your ambitions and other illusions. 

An event or story is complete only when it ends.

The personal life of the seeker of truth is enhanced by remembering death.

'To forget' is balanced by to 'to remember'.

The heart knows, but what do we know of the heart and how it knows?

Most of us will naturally experience loneliness until we fully embrace our inner soul.

Loneliness is a primal desire to be at one with the soul, the real union.

You are fortunate if you reach a point where you really don't know who you are, with your mind and intellect intact.

We often welcome what is new, provided it does not displace a cherished old value or object unless it brings greater benefits.

Surprise is what is not expected; we like the surprise that enhances life and dislike what increases fear and suffering.

There will always be something that we miss, yet we don't want to miss anything we consider good.

Leisure and pleasure may often lead to degrading consciousness, unless there is conscious effort to transcend mind and the senses.

Whenever you think you have some extra space or time, they often get filled with waste material.

Your fate allows your choice.

There is no option in desiring options or in hoping to choose the appropriate one.

All deception or falsehood contains a spark of truth.

The flip side of an inferior state can be a superior one, imagined or real.

The self enjoys power, wealth, acknowledgement, respect, status, control, victory, achievement, success, constancy, highest beauty, ease, comfort, luxury, pomp, ceremony, admiration and adoration.

The self is never wrong, instant gratification, desirable, contentment, free to do anything anytime, access to any knowledge desired.

The self loves to be considered generous, fair, correct, compassionate, patient, knowing, forgiving, trusting, and courageous.

If you believe in a supreme and just God, then you accept whatever has affected you as it could only happen with God's approval.

Self-image, self-esteem, and presitge are important for the young but can be an obstacle and handicap for mature seekers of truth.

The ultimate spiritual challenge is to transcend the mind and realise that two plus two is still one.

You experience super confidence when you have gone past the illusion of self-confidence.
