# Consciousness, Connectivity, and Continuity

What is experienced as real and true is a glimpse of what is absolutely real and true.

Every living creature is driven to connect with what is relevant for survival and continuity to experience life.

Everything expresses its state in numerous ways, but the mind's natural concern for survival filters out most of these messages.

Body, mind and emotions are the earthly faculties that connect with our heavenly origin of light - the soul.

Body, mind and self are transitions in consciousness, energised by the soul and supreme consciousness.

Pleasure is when you experience desirable connectedness and its continuities, whereas displeasure is due to undesirable connections or discontinuity.

Reason and rationality are like ladders that lead to the zone of pure consciousness that is the source of life and all mental and sensory experiences.

Wisdom is about context, relevance, balance - appropriateness in time and place.

Wisdom starts with useful knowledge and leads to beyond all differentiation and earthly values.

You may get what you longed and dreamt for, but the next desire and hope may negate everything before.

Celebrate achievement and certainty, but accept cheerfully the nature of our wordly experience with its constant uncertainty.

Even the greatest lie contains a spark of truth.

Normality means balance, reliability and a combined state of change and constancy at the same time. Normal breathing is different from gasping for breath.

All constants, including scientific ones, are also relative but less than others.

Acting upon little wisdom is better than accumulating unused knowledge.

Wisdom, discernment and insights are a prelude to experiencing the ever-present conclusion: sacred presence beyond mind, sight, or self.

What we can measure and describe is only an aspect of what is immeasurable, defies definition, and is beyond mental comprehension.

If the earth is one year old, then humanity is twenty seconds old and the West rules for two seconds - reflect on this perspective.

Worse than a lie is to deny it. If you're in someone else's situation you would do exactly as they did - right or wrong.
