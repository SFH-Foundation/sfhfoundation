# Journey 16 - Life

The mystery of life and consciousness is veiled by the illusion of individuality, personal identity and the fantasy of free will.  

In truth, all existence is a lie searching for its origin: the Truth.  

Life is sacred and eternal; every living creature is obsessed with it.  

The purpose of earthly life is to realise Life itself - eternal and perfect.  

Every living creature is obsessed with its life and its preservation.  

Life manifests as a discernible experience, energised by unseen forces, within a timeframe.  

Human life may seem short, but life itself is eternal and causes human life.  

The obsession to prolong life simple reflects the eternal nature of life.  

Pain is the guardian of the continuity of life.  

Love of life is accompanied by fear of the death, unless you are awakened to perpetual life.  

The body is alive due to the unconditional love of the soul, which connects it to life's source.  

Living creatures love life and fear death. Few humans discover that the true nature of life itself is eternal.  

To attain a complete and fulfilled life you must be at one with your heavenly origin - the soul within.  

The desire to be useful is to experience being able to act for a purpose. Life's overall purpose is to realise the perfection of all that exists and its governance.  

Everything one does is essentially motivated by a passionate obsession with life.  

Human life's ultimate purpose is to complete the seamless connectedness of the present moment with timelessness.  

The natural universe is not silent or noisy. It is in perfect turmoil and cycles of interaction between matter and energies - self-organising.

Plants are rooted in earth and nourished by air, sun and sky: they are both earthly and heavenly, as are all living creatures.  

The full meaning and challenges of life are revealed through reflection and meditation.  

Life is the greatest plot! In conscious life, one quests for knowledge and appropriate action, yet the beginning and end of one's life are shrouded in silence.

Intelligence facilitates the continuation of consciousness.
