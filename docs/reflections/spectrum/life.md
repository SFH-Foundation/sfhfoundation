# Life

<div class="aphorism-text">

The mystery of life and consciousness is veiled by the illusion of individuality, personal identity and the fantasy of free will.  

<div class="div"></div>

In truth, all existence is a lie searching for its origin: the Truth.  

<div class="div"></div>

Life is sacred and eternal; every living creature is obsessed with it.  

<div class="div"></div>

The purpose of earthly life is to realise Life itself - eternal and perfect.  

<div class="div"></div>

Pain is the guardian of the continuity of life.  

<div class="div"></div>

Life manifests as a discernible experience, energised by unseen forces, within a timeframe.  

<div class="div"></div>

Human life may seem short, but life itself is eternal and causes human life. 

<div class="div"></div>

The obsession to prolong life simple reflects the eternal nature of life.  

<div class="div"></div>

Love of life is accompanied by fear of the death, unless you are awakened to perpetual life.    

<div class="div"></div>

To attain a complete and fulfilled life you must be at one with your heavenly origin - the soul within.  

<div class="div"></div>  

Everything one does is essentially motivated by a passionate obsession with life.
