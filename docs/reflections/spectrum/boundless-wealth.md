# Boundless Wealth

<div class="aphorism-text">

Beauty is within the innermost of everything that exists - even within what appears ugly.  

<div class="div"></div>

The ego is a natural protector of the soul early in life. It is as usefulness as a shell covering a delicate pearl.  

<div class="div"></div>

Our soul or spirit carries all the qualities of the cosmic source of the universe, including fortune, wealth and boundless power.  

<div class="div"></div>

When outer beauty is not matched by inner beauty, cosmetic decoration is mockery and deception.  

<div class="div"></div>

The mind requires balance, equanimity and sobriety. The heart deals with spiritual lights and delights beyond limitations.  

<div class="div"></div>

The future is being shaped in the present and the past had its presence. Now is fully present.  

<div class="div"></div>

Whatever exists has a touch of beauty and majesty. 

<div class="div"></div>
