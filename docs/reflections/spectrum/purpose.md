# Purpose

<div class="aphorism-text">

The purpose of human life is to experience existence through the lens of Oneness without denying the temporary experience of pluralities.  

<div class="div"></div>

We desire a life that increases in its knowledge, contentment and happiness and that state relates to the soul’s nature — God’s will.  

<div class="div"></div>

Every movement and action declares its purpose. Ultimately, spiritual stillness implies access to higher consciousness that is beyond drives and needs. 

<div class="div"></div>

To experience the boundless eternal zone of consciousness - the soul's essence - we need to transcend all our human states.  

<div class="div"></div>

We occasionally experience the perfect moment - no thought, intention or action. That instant reveals our soul's perfect state.  

<div class="div"></div>

Whatever exists has an aspect of the sacred.

<div class="div"></div>

Human life's ultimate purpose is to complete the seamless connectedness of the present moment with timelessness.
