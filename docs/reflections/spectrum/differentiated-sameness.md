# Differentiated Sameness

<div class="aphorism-text">

In truth, whatever you do to others, you do to yourself.  

<div class="div"></div>

In our outer appearance we all seem different, yet in our quest and desire we are the same. Reality or God is the sublime, incomparable Light of lights. That uniqueness is reflected in our own soul.  

<div class="div"></div>

Unless you connect on higher consciousness, then conditioned consciousness highlights differences rather than sameness and harmony.  

<div class="div"></div>

The paradox is that the human soul is both exclusive (you have it) and inclusive (everyone lives by it).  

<div class="div"></div>

A politician strives to reduce inequality whereas a sage knows everyone is inwardly equal and outwardly different.  

<div class="div"></div>

Longing to belong, we all strive to belong to the greatest and most desirable: our soul.  

<div class="div"></div>

A human being is a product of the past and the present. The future is a continuation of that stream of consciousness modified by will and interactions.
