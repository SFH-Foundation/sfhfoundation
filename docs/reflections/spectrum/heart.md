# Heart 

<div class="aphorism-text">

Your heart is really safe when you hear without ears and see without eyes.  

<div class="div"></div>

Our earthly journey is temporary and futile, unless it leads to the unison between head and heart. That state leads to soul consciousness.  

<div class="div"></div>

Most common folk look for the price of things but are ignorant about the treasure and joy within the heart.  

<div class="div"></div>

Looking for a soulmate is an outer drive energized by your own soul within you: the ever-present soulmate.  

<div class="div"></div>

To miss someone is a reminder of missing the One - your own soul.  

<div class="div"></div>

To see one object clearly you need two eyes. To realise truth, you also need one clear head and a pure, unattached heart.

<div class="div"></div>

The heart knows, but what do we know of the heart and how it knows?

<div class="div"></div>

A peaceful heart is at rest with passionate adoration and beyond all competition or cooperation.  

<div class="div"></div>

Every moment brings about a new uncertainty and the tranquil heart is content with that reality. 

<div class="div"></div>
