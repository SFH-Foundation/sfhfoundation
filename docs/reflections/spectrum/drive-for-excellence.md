# Drive for Excellence

<div class="aphorism-text">

No-one is denied the drive towards excellence - the wise one sees the perfection of every outcome, irrespective of conventional evaluation and judgement.

<div class="div"></div>

We are impressionable creatures and need outer references until we can access our own inner soul - the resident teacher.  

<div class="div"></div>

We want guidance that shows us the truth within our own heart. We need commitment and consistency along the path so the self yields to its root and origin - the inner soul.

<div class="div"></div>

The desire to excel in the world and to experience acknowledgment is an echo of the greatness and superiority of the nature of our own soul.  

<div class="div"></div>

To mimic the stroke of a golf champion can be helpful, but to mimic a sage may be a dangerous distraction. Love, follow, and be transformed.  

<div class="div"></div>

Appropriateness implies clear intention, appropriate action and full presence in the moment - preludes for spiritual awakening.  

<div class="div"></div>

The drive towards excellence and perfection is a primary force in us, reflecting the perfect soul within.
