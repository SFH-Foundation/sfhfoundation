# Journey 9 - Truth and Light

<div class="aphorism-text">

Everything in life can be discussed, analyzed and evaluated except TRUTH: it is due to it that we differentiate and understand.

<div class="div"></div>

Our desire for truth, justice and fairness is a beam of light that emanates from Oneness and pervades the universe - from where all has emanated.  

<div class="div"></div>

Anything that moves and changes is subject to the limitations of space and time and has a temporary reality. The Real is ever constant.  

<div class="div"></div>

So long as you discriminate, you are looking through the shadows and not the original light.  

<div class="div"></div>

Wisdom is a spectrum - at one end it has to do with rationality and good guidance, and at the other end it is pure, infinite light.  

<div class="div"></div>

Wisdom is of many levels and, like light, can illuminate and guide, or dazzle and confuse.   

<div class="div"></div>

Disappointments will continue until you reach the real appointment - Truth.

<div class="div"></div>

Harmony and bliss surround the light of sacredness which is the source of life and consciousness.

<div class="div"></div>

No person can help you realise the truth, but may be helpful to remove some falsehood and ignorance. Truth reveals itself by itself when the recipient is ready.

<div class="div"></div>

The seeker and the sought are in the shadows of Truth.

<div class="div"></div>

Truth is beyond the reach of rationality and reason and is the cause of all mental processes. 

<div class="div"></div>

We look for truth within facts. In truth, facts are basic indicators of truth.

<div class="div"></div>

In Truth there is only Truth.
