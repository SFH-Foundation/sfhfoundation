# Balance

<div class="aphorism-text">

Consciously and subconsciously, we are balanced between life forces interacting within time and space.  

<div class="div"></div>

Sleep puts an end to our wakeful state and transcendence of mind takes us to the doorway of the infinite, eternal Light. One state ends for the other to begin.  

<div class="div"></div>

Every beginning connects to its end.  

<div class="div"></div>

Whatever is wrong will not move in the natural flow of life â€“ whatever is right just fits well.  

<div class="div"></div>

The flip side of an inferior state can be a superior one, imagined or real.

<div class="div"></div>

'To forget' is balanced by to 'to remember'.

<div class="div"></div>

The present contains all the past and points to the future.  

<div class="div"></div>

You have two wings which give you a balanced flight.  The first wing is that of reason and earthly wisdom and the other is your spiritual awakening. With your earthly wing alone, you remain earthbound and unfulfilled.  

<div class="div"></div>

Our drive to overcome obstacles and difficulties in life reflects our desirable destination - perfect and perpetual ease. 

<div class="div"></div>

Normality means balance, reliability and a combined state of change and constancy at the same time. Normal breathing is different from gasping for breath.

<div class="div"></div>

Truth is in absolute perfect balance and, in our relative and changing world, all imbalances are short-lived.

<div class="div"></div>

Universal changing diversity is balanced by original cosmic constant Unity.
