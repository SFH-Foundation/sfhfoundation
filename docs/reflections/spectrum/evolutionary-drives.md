# Evoltuionary Drives

It is high intelligence to question the meaning of progress and development and where it leads to so far as fulfilled life is concerned.  

Every decline or fall contributes to the future rise and evolvement of consciousness.  

Human quest for freedom and liberation doesn't end except by awakening to the soul's light and its consciousness of the sacred present, beyond space and time and including all that there is within them.  

We need stability, reliability, and constancy to awaken to the real and perpetual ever-present Truth.  

Money is power and we love its acquisition until we are at one with the most powerful source - the soul within.  

Easy success may easily lead to failure.  

There is some goodness in being on a direction, whether good or bad. There is only confusion and loss in meandering aimlessly in darkness.  

Confidence points towards certainty without dismissing uncertainty.  

Uncertainty is constant and certain, always.  

The gift of having choice may lead to the freedom of no choice.  

Every fact reveals an aspect of truth.  

Every time is perfect.  

The drive for contentment and happiness points twowards higher consciousness.  

Self-expression is energised by soul's grace to help with rise in consciousness.  

Self-preservation is a mere reflection of the truth that life is perpetual and eternal.  

We are indebted to generosity and our ultimate indebtedness is to the source of all generosities - God.
