# Reflections

This section is organised into separate "journeys". Each saying is - in itself - a key to wisdom and deeper understanding. The intention is that you travel through each journey separately and return numerous times as each stage takes you deeper into your own heart.

## Stop

<div class="callout6">
It is a wise one who is always hopeful to learn meanings and lessons from difficulties and hardships.

Human beings reflect the cosmic perfection at the point of conception but, as we grow, errors and defects arise in accordance with entropy. Our apparent freedom of action only increases our imperfections. If we are willing to stop, our chances of an appropriate start are greater. When the stop/start frequency resonates within head and heart, the ‘self and soul connection’ is stronger. Unity in consciousness is the fruit of spiritual evolvement which encompasses the seen and unseen worlds.
