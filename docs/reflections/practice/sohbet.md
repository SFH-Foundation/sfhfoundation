# Etiquette for Sohbet/Suhbah

In a tradition, the Prophet (PBUH) said: 

> “Acquiring knowledge in company for an hour in the night is better than spending the whole night in prayer.” 

Whether in virtual or actual space, a _sohbet_ is an opportunity to draw deep nourishment and inspiration. To which end please observe the following:
 
- Be in _wudu_.
- Be attentive in presence. Ensure you don’t rush into a _sohbet_ after attending to matters that will affect your ability to focus. 
- Sit in a quiet space where you won’t be disturbed.
- Wear loose, clean, and comfortable clothes. 
- Turn off your telephone and other electronic devices that might interfere. 
- If this is a virtual _sohbet_ ensure you have enough battery in your laptop or device and good internet connection. 
- Keep your microphone switched off. 
- Ensure you join the _sohbet_ at the designated time. 
- If you are joining late, turn off your microphone and camera so that you don’t disturb other participants as you enter. 
- If you have a question related to the topic of discussion raise a virtual hand and wait for the facilitator, organiser, or Shaykh to recognise you. 
- Do not interject when someone else is speaking, particularly the Shaykh. 
- The virtual _sohbet_ should normally include no more than 12 including the Shaykh and the organiser/ facilitator. 
- If there is a particular subject to be discussed, the organiser should let everyone know well in advance so participants can prepare for the meeting.
- If you do not have a particular question don’t formulate one unnecessarily – it is not necessary to speak or comment in order to benefit.
- When you do speak, be as brief as possible. 
- Regard your participation as a blessing and not as cause for enhanced self-regard.
