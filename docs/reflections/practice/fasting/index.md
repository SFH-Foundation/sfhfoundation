## Book Description

_<a href="https://zahrapublications.pub/book-TransformativeWorshipInIslam.php#bookTitle" target="_blank">Transformative Worship in Islam – Experiencing Perfection_</a> uniquely bridges the traditional practices and beliefs, culture and language of Islam with the transformative spiritual states described by the Sufis and Gnostics. In this collection of teachings on how the worship of Islam can transform insight and perception of Reality, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri presents profound guidance for those who journey through the path of Islamic belief and practice. He draws from the Noble Qur’an, the Prophet’s traditions, narrations from the Ahl al-Bayt and seminal works
from Sufi masters and scholars.

_<a href="https://zahrapublications.pub/book-TransformativeWorshipInIslam.php#bookTitle" target="_blank">Transformative Worship in Islam – Experiencing Perfection_</a> will inspire the serious seeker of spiritual knowledge to make the connections between intention, attention and direction. Describing in detail the stages of spiritual evolvement, the author highlights the need for grooming the self, refining its lower tendencies, practicing self-accountability, and guiding it towards the higher virtues of the soul, through the regular discipline of a worship which brings one into Divine Presence. The seeker will be taken to the stages of self-realization where all dualities meet and unify within the human soul. The purified heart is a precondition for this awakening, while enlightenment is the natural outcome after dispelling all causes of egotistic confusion and concern for personal survival. This book reveals how the soul is forever embedded in sustainable joy and contentment and awakening to this condition is not only our birth-right but the very purpose of our existence.

## Fasting (sawm)

Human interest in fasting is deeply rooted in our consciousness. Fasting has long been resorted
to for maintaining physical and mental health as much as for cultural or political reasons. More
specifically, fasting has been a devotional practice in most religious and spiritual movements
throughout the ages. Islam has prescribed the practice of abstinence and fasting as a means of self-purification and worship. The act of restraining the self from fulfilling its desires purifies and enhances awareness at physical, mental and spiritual levels and sensitizes human consciousness. The seeker realizes the weakness of the self and is gratified by the discipline, restriction and prohibitions, for these limitations are windows to Allah’s limitlessness.

### Fasting in History

In many cultures, such as the Indians of North America, tribes of Brazil, the people of the Pacific Islands and numerous Asian, African and European peoples, fasting has been used as a rite of initiation, marking puberty, prior to hunting and as part of the rites of marriage. In some cultures, such as those in the Andaman Islands, Fiji, Samoa, China, Korea and others fasting is observed as a rite of mourning. In general, we find whenever human beings are in need, suppressed, or in fear, they seek God or higher powers through abstinence or penance. When our limited state of knowledge and consciousness is insufficient fasting guides us out of difficulties to find other means of inspiration and solutions.

Ancient Egyptians, Greek, Roman, and Chinese cultures practiced fasting to cure various
illnesses. The Egyptians believed that fasting three days a month helped to preserve good mental
and physical health. The Greeks learned the virtues of fasting from the Egyptians and fasted
before battle and the Romans followed suit. Socrates and Plato are known to have regularly
performed fasts of ten days duration. Today in the West, fasting is used by alternative and
naturopathic systems of medicine and healing for curing a host of acute and chronic diseases and
as a useful catalyst in helping the body mobilize its own natural immune system.

The Old Testament often refers to fasting: David chastened his soul with fasting, while Moses
fasted for forty days when he ascended the mount to receive the tablets of the covenant. Daniel
fasted for three weeks, supplicating and praying all the while. Jews observe six obligatory fasts
during the year, one such being Yom Kippur.  

The institution of fasting and abstinence from certain foods in Christianity has its origin in the
New Testament as it relates to the fasting of Jesus’ disciples for several days during Lent, the
forty-day period before Easter. The duration of the fast during Lent varied throughout the ages,
until forty days accompanied by strict rules became the norm. Additional fasts were introduced
later in different parts of the Church, such as the fast of Rogation Days, the Ember Weeks, the
Whitsun Week, and fasts were also ordained by the Roman Catholic Church. Considerable
variations in the practice of fasting are noticed between the Orthodox Church, the Eastern
Orthodox Church and the Reformed Churches of Europe.

Over time there has been a gradual mitigation in the frequency and rigor of the fasts and
abstinences prescribed by Church laws due to extenuating circumstances such as age, health,
poverty, hard or continued labor and changing social conditions. Today few are obliged to fast
strictly, while some are excused even from abstinence. Roman Catholic legislation further
provides for dispensations to be granted by the Church authorities. The overall result is that the
practice of fasting has declined and is almost forgotten as a religious exercise.

During the twentieth century fasting has sometimes been used as a tool of political and social
protest by individuals as well as groups. During the national struggles for independence from
colonial rule, several leaders of the third world in Asia and Africa resorted to fasting to highlight their plight and struggle, often with some success.

### The Islamic Fast

For Muslims fasting, or _sawm_ in Arabic, was commanded in the Qur’an as a major obligatory
spiritual discipline for the duration of the month of Ramadan. The Arabic word for fasting is
derived from the root, _sama_, meaning to abstain from food, drink, smoking, sensual
gratifications, wrong actions, harmful intentions, thoughts, words and deeds.

Islamic fasting is obligatory for one month in every lunar year, that is, Ramadan, the ninth month
in the Islamic calendar. All healthy adults are expected to adhere to the proper rules of fasting. In addition to this obligatory fast, there are many optional fasts, some of which occur regularly every week or month, and some that are scattered throughout the year. These fasts are Sunnah, or the practice of the Prophet. Fasting is also used as a penance for breaking an oath and as a compensation for some other religious obligation.

The fast of Ramadan begins with the physical sighting of the new moon. Throughout the month
a Muslim may not eat or drink from daybreak (when a fine strip of light may be seen on the
horizon) until the sun has set. Before dawn a small meal (_suhur_) is usually recommended to be
taken, although not obligatory, and the fast is broken just before the sunset (_maghrib_) prayer
traditionally with dates and water, to be immediately followed by the prayer. Later on a larger
meal is partaken by the entire family, often shared with relatives, friends and guests.

The daily fast is begun by formulating the intention to perform the fast as a rite by making a
clear intention (_niyyah_) to observe the fast. No one should fast if their health cannot sustain it or if a fast should threaten one’s health. Pregnant and nursing women whose health may be harmed are exempted, as are those who are travelling away from home. When health is restored or other conditions for not fasting are removed (such as menstruation) then the person is expected to
make up the fast later during the course of the year.

Ramadan offers the believer an opportunity to mark an end to daily indulgences, or at least to
impose clear limits on a daily basis for the duration of a month. This daily restraint breaks the
habitual patterns of the self and constitutes a purification both of body and spirit, which brings
about renewal of strength and greater spiritual awareness. Each and every ritualistic practice of
Islam disciplines the individual and strengthens Muslim society if applied thoroughly.

Every year the month of Ramadan falls at different times because the lunar calendar is shorter
than the solar by approximately ten days. This means that as the period of the fast is brought
forward annually, Ramadan will fall during all seasons of the year in a gradual progression.
Despite the strict rules and restraint induced by the fast, Ramadan is usually a joyful time for
Muslims everywhere. The last ten nights of the month, particularly the odd nights, are the spiritual highlights of Ramadan, for one of these nights is _Laylat al-Qadr_, the Night of
Determination, in which the Qur’an was first revealed to the Prophet. During these nights
Muslims spend their nights in supplication and prayer, hoping to favorably influence the course
of events that will unfold subsequently. 

Ramadan comes to a close with the celebrations and prayers of _Eid al-Fitr_. On this day a Muslim
will give appropriate alms to the poor, and families gather for a light morning repast after the
congregational prayer. The Eid prayer, usually performed outdoors is accompanied by a
discourse delivered by the prayer leader after which people exchange good wishes and celebrate
their success in performing a most important act of worship and attaining a heightened awareness
and purposefulness in life.

The Prophet of Allah said:  

<div clas="callout">
The root of Islam is prayer, its branches are the obligatory tax, its height is the fast, and its expanse is striving in the way of Allah.
</div>

He also said:

<div class="callout">
The tax of the body is fasting.
</div>

A Jew who was one of the most learned of his people asked the Messenger of Allah: ‘Why did
Allah make it obligatory upon your people to fast throughout the day for thirty days?’ The
Prophet replied:

<div class="callout">
When Adam ate from the tree it remained within his stomach for thirty days, so Allah made it obligatory upon his offspring to experience thirty days of hunger and thirst. Whatever they eat at night is a grace from Allah. Thus, it was with Adam, so Allah made the same obligatory for my people.
</div>

Then he recited the verse:

<img class="quran" src="/gatherings-volunteer/img/cow_2_183.png" />

<img class="quran-m" src="/gatherings-volunteer/img/m_cow_2_183.png" />

The fast is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you. <a href="https://quran.com/2/183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2:183</a>

Imam al-Rida wrote the following concerning the obligation to fast:

**"It is so that one may know the feeling of hunger and thirst, so that he will be humble and helpless, in order to be an indication of the difficulties of the Hereafter. Within it is contained the breaking of desires so that one will experience the deprivations caused by withholding from the poor and the needy."**

Imam al-Sadiq relates that the Prophet said:

**"The fast is a shield, that is, a veil protecting one from the afflictions of the world and from the punishment of the Hereafter. Thus, when you fast, make the intention to restrain your self from its desires and cut off the thoughts inspired by Shaytan. Bring yourself to the place where you are content without the desire for food or drink."**
