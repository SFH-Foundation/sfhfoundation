# The Keys To Meditation

## Beginner's Mind

A healthy mind is a medium that connects energy and matter with meanings and value. A fresh mind evaluates new events and experiences without preconceptions. Nowadays, the idea of mindfulness implies being focused and single pointed. The beginner’s mind is less cluttered with memories and prejudices. It connects the ever-changing consciousness, with supreme consciousness. It has a chance to transcend personal discernment and evaluation to higher states of pure witnessing.

The beginner’s mind is fresh, flexible, and close to the door of eternal presence and the infinite Nowness.

## Emptying Out 

The purpose of your being here is to recognise the knowledge that is already rooted within you. However, because we have allowed ourselves to become overgrown with the concerns of this life, this knowledge has had no chance to grow. So we have to pluck out the weeds of concern. As the people of gnosis say, “First we must empty ourselves.” And how do we do this except by recognizing that cheating one another is of no use and that hoarding is of no use? By experience we learn that these things are not going to make us happier. The reason why we want money is to have the potential of freeing ourselves from future desires. So then why have future desires? It is so simple. 

Once we learn this then emptying out becomes sweet. Once our fear of death and concerns for provision in this life are weeded out, the process of displacing our old values by higher timeless values becomes a joy. 

## To Activate and Access Your Heart

This world contains samples of all creations and states, seen and unseen, including paradise and hell. Human life is a process of learning through acceptance and rejection. To activate and access your heart, you need to reduce outer worldly concerns. To understand fully the greatness, power and perfection of the present moment, you need to cleanse the mind from its past or future fears. Only then can you live now. To be more in heaven you need to be less worldly. To live the moment fully, you must go beyond space-time.

You are a celestial soul or spirit on an earthly voyage exploring duality, yearning for your source and origin of unity.
