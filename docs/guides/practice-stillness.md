# The Practices of Stillness, Meditation and Supplication

Generally there are three stages in the practice of stillness in body, mind, and heart.

## Stillness

### 1. Preparation and Intention

This preliminary stage is intended to help you overcome the natural mental noise that goes on in your head. Anything that exists seeks to perpetuate itself. All thoughts are froth from the neuron circuitry, so allow them to exhaust themselves and leave you.

Ensure that the possibilities for being interrupted are kept to a minimum and that your attention is not diverted to worldly needs. As you do your _wudu_ concentrate on the meaning of every movement, using each one as an opportunity to purify the decaying body (see [Transformative Worship](../../books/general-islam/transformative-worship) for more on this).

Sound is a powerful tool when used repetitively as a way of tricking the mind through self-hypnosis to reduce the circling of thoughts and bring them to one point. It is not so much the intensity of being mindful but the frequency and constancy. This approach incorporates any of a dozen methodologies or ways.

**Recitation of Qur’an** 
Sit quietly and follow a recitation or read aloud yourself. Repeat only a few ayat of your choice.

**Dhikr**
This is an opportunity to leave behind your identity, your biography, your worries. Choose a _dhikr_ that is effective for you.  Recite the Name ‘Allah’ in any fashion, or any other Divines Names.  For example, if you are ill ‘Ya Shāfī Ya Mu’āfī’ may be helpful;  if worried for provisions, ‘Ya Fattāh Ya Razzāq‘.

**Visualisation**
Visualize anything you are comfortable and familiar with, such as a divine name on the horizon, a colour, rainbows etc. Whatever you choose, concentrate on it. For example, take a rose in your hand and ask it permission to de-petal it. Your mind is a trickster; you have to outwit it.

**Breath**
Become aware of inhaling and exhaling, extending the period of exhalation.

### 2. Entering the Ocean

The moment you have made your intention you are on the shore wading in, in the hope that the sea will engulf you and that you will lose all self-consciousness, self-awareness and identity.

In Muslim cultures, certain terms were used to denote meditative retreats, such as _khalwa_ (which connotes a status and prestige that is quite misplaced and abused in this day and age), _i’tikāf_  (which has remained a tradition practised during the last 10 days of Ramadan) and _‘uzla_ (a more neutral term denoting setting oneself aside).

Whilst wading through the shallows, many aspects of the self will be revealed to you. Allow them to emerge, face them with courage, and allow them to exhaust themselves. When dealing with aspects of your shadow, it is useful to imagine that you are in the guesthouse described by Rumi, welcoming each without judgement, and then eventually watching them recede. Persist and be patient and do not judge your progress because this zone takes the bulk of energy and time.

### 3. Transcending Space and Time

As you are wading, there may be occasions when you slip or lose your foothold; do not panic but be patient. Now you are approaching the deep end: experiencing different qualities of silence. Flow with that state with trust but no fear. You are now entering a zone of higher consciousness that is at the edge of truth.

All these approaches will help move you along towards higher consciousness.

## Keys to Meditation

### Beginner's Mind

A healthy mind is a medium that connects energy and matter with meanings and value. A fresh mind evaluates new events and experiences and considers advantages and benefits for fulfilment. Nowadays, the idea of mindfulness implies being focused and single pointed. Mindlessness may equate to oblivion without any sense of time or identity.  

The beginner’s mind is less cluttered with memories and prejudices. It connects the ever-changing consciousness, with supreme consciousness. It has a chance to transcend personal discernment and evaluation to higher states of pure witnessing.  

**_The beginner’s mind is fresh, flexible, and close to the door of eternal presence and the infinite Nowness_**.

### Emptying Out 

The purpose of your being here is to obtain knowledge, the knowledge that is rooted within you. But because we have allowed ourselves to become overgrown with the concerns of this life, this knowledge has had no chance to grow. So we have to pluck out the weeds of concern. As the people of gnosis say, “First we must empty ourselves.” And how do we do this except by recognizing that cheating one another is of no use and that hoarding is of no use? By experience we learn that these things are not going to make us happier. The reason why we want money is to have the potential of freeing ourselves from future desires. So then why have future desires? It is so simple. 

Once we learn this then emptying out becomes sweet. Once our fear of death and concerns for provision in this life are weeded out, the process of displacing our old values by higher timeless values becomes a joy. 

### To Activate and Access Your Heart

This world contains samples of all creations and states, seen and unseen, including paradise and hell. Human life is a process of learning through acceptance and rejection. To activate and access your heart, you need to reduce outer worldly concerns. To understand fully the greatness, power and perfection of the present moment, you need to cleanse the mind from its past or future fears. Only then can you live now. To be more in heaven you need to be less worldly. To live the moment fully, you must go beyond space-time.    

## Supplication

### A Prophetic Supplication to Remove Darkness and Impurity and Attract Light

The mirror of the heart of the seeker becomes clearer and the signs of the Realm of Divine Power and the lights of the Spiritual Regions become manifest there. It is for this reason that the Prophet (pbuh) used to beseech the following in his whispered supplications:

> “O Allah, make a light in my heart, a light in my hearing, a light in my vision, a light in my flesh, a light in my blood, a light in my bones, a light before me, a light after me, a light on my right, a light on my left, a light above me, and a light below me, a light in my heart. O Allah, increase me in light and make me a light (I beseech You) by what is Your due, O most Merciful of the Merciful.”

This supplication removes darkness and impurity and attracts light, purity and virtue. If it is accepted one joins the People of the Spiritual Regions and the Realm of Divine Power, with the appropriate potential.

### Withdrawal And Drawing Near  

> “My servant does not draw near to Me with anything more beloved than by way of the obligations which I have ordained for him. He may draw near to me with additional actions (nawafil) if I love him. If I love him I become his hearing by which he hears and the sight by which he sees. I become the tongue by which he speaks and his hand with which he grasps. If he asks me in prayer I will answer him, and if he beseeches Me I will grant it to him.”        

The language of distance is metaphorical, for Allah is not subject to place or time, for He pervades the universe and beyond – Allahu Akbar. If the decree of tawhid or unity prevails, being far or being near is merely a function of an individual's perceptual framework, the state of which is itself modulated by the degree of higher consciousness. Since, however, our experience of life is moderated by patterns of duality along a spectrum of extremes, the idea of being close or far can be helpful in distinguishing levels of awareness.  

Drawing ‘near’ is always preceded by withdrawal from all else. Pre-eminent among the things which one turns to other than Allah is the self itself and its various spheres of influence, which are:

1. The sphere of senses, that is, the connection with the material realm of nature.
2. The sphere of emotions and the realms of allegory and symbolism.  
3. The sphere of reason and intellect’s true essence; this realm is void of matter and form.

The serious worshipper, in his prostration, passes by these three spheres as he withdraws from the world and enters into a sacred state beyond the mind.  

> “And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him completely” – Qur'an, 73:8  

Being with people, serving them, and putting up with their difficulties is balanced by the act of withdrawal, seclusion, and reflection. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) regularly spent time in the cave called Hira outside Makkah for several days at a time. It was at the culmination of such periods that revelation occurred. The Qur’an describes the 40 days Moses spent in seeking his Lord, before he was given the ‘tablets’. The tradition of 40 days of seclusion (_khalwah_ or _chillah_, from _chehel_, forty in Persian) was taken by Sufi Masters to be a rite of passage, a serious emptying out (_khalwah_ derives from _khaliya_, to empty out): 

> "And when you are free [of worldly concerns] … then turn your desire to your Lord" – Qur'an 94:7-8.  

Smaller periods of time are also practiced regularly. The smallest period is ultimately symbolized by the salat which punctuates the day five times, giving us the chance to reconnect in awareness with the underlying reality that grounds our existence.

## The Origin

Ultimately, we're seeking the origin for everything. How did it come about? How did an insect evolve to become what it is? What is the origin of an idea? How did the notion of God come about? What is the origin of life? Who am I descended from? Maybe there was a great being or hero among my ancestors. Perhaps that is why I feel special!

We want to identify with power, honour and glory. This quest is within conditioned consciousness. What, however, is the origin of the seed of questing origin? That primal drive is inseparable from life, consciousness and the root and origin of the beginning of creation. We have evolved to be aware of awareness itself. Consider the four main substances: fire, water, air and earth. Fire and light are at the root of conscious life. Our nervous system depends upon electromagnetic actions upon neurons. Without air for a few minutes, the brain is dead. Without water and all the minerals, we cannot survive. Our origin is cosmic and we have within us all of the attributes of cosmic dust and lights. Over a hundred different elements. Our physical survival, depends upon other living creatures, animals and plants. We maintain ourselves by eating fruit and roots and vegetables whose origin is dust, water, air and sun. But human survival needs more than earth and water – our life is dependent on more basic forms of life.

Within conditioned consciousness, we question, reflect, share, and try to discover what the original cause is. Once we are at the point of neutrality, then the light of inner perception beams from the Soul, reflecting the divine spirit of the Origin. The question is replaced with a taste of Reality and the experience of Oneness – a glorious answer which ends all questions – your personal entity is now in inseparable connection with the Cosmic Reality.
