This was most powerful and timely talk on the two aspects of life: the temporary and the eternal.

In this succinct and illuminating talk on the light of The Holy Qurâ€™an, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri uses <a target="_blank" href="https://quran.com/103">Surah Al-Asr</a>, the Chapter of Time, and two other powerful verses to provide a summation, conclusion, prescription and description of the Path to Eternal Life.

Life appears in two zones: the earthly zone is temporary and begins with birth and ends in death. 

The second zone is one of permanence in which Life is forever, because God is forever. 

Shaykh Fadhlalla explains the need to take reference from and calibrate with The Author, God. For unless you do that your role is that of the usurper. 

The Prescription on the Prophetic path is decoded from <a target="_blank" href="https://quran.com/33/45-46">Surah Ahzab, Ayat 45, 46</a>.

The balance is accepting humanity but recognising felicity, joy & bliss - <a target="_blank" href="https://quran.com/11/108">Surah Hud, Ayat 108</a>.

This talk was broadcast on **Sunday, February 13, 2022**.
