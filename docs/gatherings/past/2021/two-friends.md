Premiered on Saturday 30th January 2021<br/><br/>
Prof. Dr. Akbar Ahmed is the Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies at American University in Washington DC and the former Pakistani High Commissioner to the UK & Ireland. These two luminaries have known each other for three decades and while they have met infrequently have remained in constant touch. We were fortunate to be able to arrange this first conversation which encompassed matters related to Metaphysics, Theology and Anthropology.
