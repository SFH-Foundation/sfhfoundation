Premiered on Saturday 13th February 2021<br/><br/>
By request of the Gulf Cultural Club and Abrar Islamic Foundation, this talk focussed on a group of Middle Eastern individuals whose specific cultural background allowed for Shaykh Fadhlalla's focus on the Holy Quran as a point of reference. The message of the Holy Quran gave a clear means to help the audience in today's world where many have found their movement, social interaction and daily life restricted due to the strictures imposed on society because of the Pandemic. Shaykh Fadhlalla's message remains very pertinent to the times that we live in.
