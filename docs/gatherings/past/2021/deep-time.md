title: Deep Time and Human History
description:
---

We are accustomed to the idea of geology and astronomy speaking the secrets of ‘deep time,’ the immense arc of non-human history that shaped the world as we perceive it. The Earth is roughly 4.5 billion years old—a number that is hard for humans to grasp. For human beings whose life span is normally less than 100 years, it’s nearly impossible to imagine something so vast as geological or deep time. Human history in perspective, when compared to ‘deep time’, is a mere flash in the pan.

Richard (RJ) Eskow is a freelance writer and the host of <a href="https://tunein.com/podcasts/Progressive-Talk/The-Zero-Hour-with-RJ-Eskow-p603878/" target="_blank" rel="noopnener noreferrer">The Zero Hour</a>, a weekly radio and TV program. He is also Senior Advisor for Health & Economic Justice at Social Security Works. He was the lead writer and editor for Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. Richard is a former consultant, public policy advisor, and senior executive in the US and more than 20 foreign countries. His writings have appeared in a number of print and digital publications.

This conversation addressed a wide spectrum of key issues of global importance. Issues like stress, violence, fear, hope, peace, human rights, what are we seeking? What is death? Why don't we celebrate death? The stress resulting from the material world we live in, the moral dilemmas we face on a day to day basis, the polarization in society and the creation of the other, and most importantly the lack of respect for the Earth and its creatures.

This second session between Richard (RJ) Eskow and Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri was based on questions from the audience of the first session broadcast on January 10, 2021. Shaykh Fadhlalla responds to these questions in his inimitable style bringing the viewer back to recognising their own humanity and finding the path to unity while understanding ‘deep time’. RJ in his usual probing style brings out a nuanced and insightful conversation.
