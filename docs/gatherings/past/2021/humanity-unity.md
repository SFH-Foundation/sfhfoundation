## Introduction

Prof. Schieffer quoted major sections from Shaykh Fadhlalla's book <a href="https://zahrapublications.pub/book-TheJourneyOfTheSelf.php#bookTitle" target="_blank">Journey of the Self</a> as part of his research that resulted in the excellent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Integral-Development-Transformative-Organisations-Transformation-ebook/dp/B01G2BGPY0/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=integral+development+schieffer&amp;qid=1614863911&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Integral Development: Realising the Transformative Potential of Individuals, Organisations, and Societies</a>.  

Prof. Schieffer wrote a number of poems in honour of this conversation which he read during the dialogue. He has recently published a book of poetry entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Firebird-Alexander-Schieffer/dp/2956051709/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=firebird+schieffer&amp;qid=1614864040&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">FIREBIRD: A Poetic Journey to Awaken the Inner Fire</a>.  

In this session, Prof. Schieffer discussed Unity as Starting-and-End-Point: the Significance of “Unity”, the Urgency of Unity: its importance in our Times, the Vitality of Unity in Diversity: the Relevance and Potential of Diversity, the Journey towards Unity: Processes that can guide us towards Unity (in Diversity), (From “Journey of the Self” of [ASK](../ask) to Releasing Genius in the Integral approach), Enabling Unity: How do we create and design “Enabling Places” to support the transformative Journey towards Unity? (From ASK to Home for Humanity), Coming Home / Manifesting the Future: On the Power of the (inner and outer) Home to Co-Create a Regenerative and Inclusive Earth Civilisation, for all Life.
