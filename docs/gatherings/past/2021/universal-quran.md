In our contemporary world where race, religion, culture, and other human characteristics meet, connect, fuse, overlap and clash, so many challenges regarding faith, belief, and metaphysical issues present themselves.

The Abrahamic traditions are the result of thousands of prophets and messengers coming to guide humankind, culminating with the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), whose gift of the Noble Qur’an is of universal value.

The potent message of the Qur’an connects infinite, unseen, cosmic lights with finite, relative, and limited earthly consciousness.

The miracle of the Qur’an is that its verses repeatedly reveal the seamless connection between heavenly powers and earthly limitations.

The <a href="https://zahrapublications.pub/book-UniversalQuran.php#bookTitle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Quran: Selected Verses for All Times</a> is an attempt to present key verses which are universally useful for all times and for all people for every moment in the human journey.

The selections made reflect the major themes of existential reality – eternal life manifesting in cyclicality and dualities, the layered consciousness and the arc of its trajectory, the keys to wholesome living, all embedded in the web of cosmic oneness and reflected in the human embodiment of awakening.

Shaykh Saadi Shakur, Syed Haider Mehdi, and Dr. Adnan AlAdnani continued to engage with Shaykh Fadhlalla, discussing the 'wise commentary and rendering of these verses as a wake-up call for all humanity, regardless of belief or philosophy of life'.

Shaykh Fadhlalla outlined some key matters framing the future series of discussions on the <a href="https://zahrapublications.pub/book-UniversalQuran.php#bookTitle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Quran</a>. The fourth talk then began to unpack the six chapters of this unique book.

## Background

This is the age where we need regular spiritual recharge and awakening to the truth within our hearts.

The Noble Qur’an is universal and useful at all times and for all people. This belief motivated Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri to select the verses that are clearly universal. Shaykh Fadhlalla rendered the meanings of the verses in an easily accessible way for the modern reader. The verses selected are renderings of the inner meaning, rather than a traditional translation.

The present needs of human beings in this day and age require more reference to the Source of creation, and Divine Light – which are largely Meccan verses, of which this book presents a selection.

The selected verses help with personal transformation and the rise in consciousness and Universal Truth, rather than with relationship, community, law, and other aspects of conduct to help recharge spiritually.

The miracle of the Noble Qur’an is that its verses repeatedly reveal the seamless connection between the infinite, unseen, cosmic lights with finite, relative, and limited earthly consciousness. This selection of key verses is universally useful for all times and for all people for every moment in the human journey.  

This book will be discussed over two sessions, where Shaykh Saadi Shakur, Syed Haider Mehdi, and Dr. Adnan AlAdnani will engage with Shaykh Fadhlalla to discuss the 'wise commentary and rendering of these verses as a wake-up call for all humanity, regardless of belief or philosophy of life'.
