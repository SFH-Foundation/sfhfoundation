There are thousands of complementary dualities. The individual and community, the micro and the macro, the one and the many, I and the rest. They either enhance or demolish each other. The virtues of an individual can also be the virtues of a community or society or a nation viz; kindness, generosity, patient, accommodating or respectful. All of these things that an individual can feel or do can be done as a family or a clan or a community. The individual can be nasty, mean, destructive and so can a group of people, communities. All of this goes up and down in cycles. A group of people who were mean and destructive, raiding, killing, and pillaging could after a dozen generations of suffering and other factors can become most accommodating, gentle, generous, and hospitable with a good quality of life. This session reflects upon the one and the many and the connectedness between them and how they enhance each other how they can destroy each other. 

Being a spiritual person is synonymous with being a person whose highest priority is to be loving to yourself and others. A spiritual person cares about people, animals, and the planet. A spiritual person knows that we are all One, and consciously attempts to honour this Oneness. A spiritual person is a kind person. 

This conversation between Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, Richard Eskow and Muna Haeri Bilgrami is an important thought-provoking discussion.

There is a big issue of duality in life that needs to be addressed. We have many questions relating to the individual and community. Anything we experience in this life is part of this duality. There are thousands of complementary dualities. The individual and community, the micro and the macro, the one and the many, I and the rest.
