> "The fast belongs to Allah… You are merely the place of its manifestation.”

Fasting in Islam removes everything from you, leaves you in a state of annihilation, and then when all you have left is your fasting, Allah takes that too because it belongs to Him. So what are you left with?

Stillness. Peace. Allah’s Infinite Presence. You become an empty vessel, and Allah fills you with light.  

> “The fast belongs to Allah… You are merely the place of its manifestation.” - Ibn Al Arabi

The seeker or wayfarer (_salik_) is the one who is traveling through the stations by the divine names. In the month of Ramadhan the traveller is moving from fasting (_misk_) to breaking it (_fitr_) and from breaking it to fast.
