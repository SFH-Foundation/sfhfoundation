## Preparation

Hope is being able to see that there is light despite all of the darkness. Hope is a motivating power that allows Allah's creation to feel delighted when working, provides a stimulus for struggling for the sake of duty, and enlivens heart, body, and soul. Indeed, there was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 

**"Hope is an elixir of life. It is the engine that propels us forward in our pursuit of countless goals, all of which might otherwise be impossible to undertake if we were bereft of hope" - Gad Saad**
