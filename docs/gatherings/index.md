## Path to Eternal Life

Do join us for this most powerful and timely talk on the two aspects of life: the temporary and the eternal.

In this brief but powerful talk on the light of The Holy Qur’an, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri uses <a target="_blank" href="https://quran.com/103">Surah Al-Asr</a>, the Chapter of Time, and two other powerful verses to provide a summation, conclusion, prescription and description of the Path to Eternal Life.

Life appears in two zones: the earthly zone is temporary and begins with birth and ends in death. 

The second zone is one of permanence in which Life is forever because God is forever. 

Shaykh Fadhlalla explains the need to take reference from and calibrate with The Author, God. For unless you do that your role is that of the usurper. 

The Prescription on the Prophetic path is decoded from <a target="_blank" href="https://quran.com/33/45-46">Surah Ahzab, Ayat 45, 46</a>.

The balance is accepting humanity but recognising felicity, joy & bliss - <a target="_blank" href="https://quran.com/11/108">Surah Hud, Ayat 108</a>.

This talk will be broadcast on **Sunday, February 13, 2022** on YouTube at **2PM CAT, 12PM London and 7AM EST (US)**.

## Differentiated Sameness

We are pleased to announce the first Audiobook by Zahra Publications:

<div class="audio-img">
<strong>Differentiated Sameness</strong><br/> 
<em>A Collection of Sufi Poems</em>  
</div>

This book of poetry by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri talks about the human journey on earth, moving from low, basic sentiency toward the highest level of consciousness. From childhood on we are challenged to witness, experience, and choose what is better for our happiness. With awakening, we discover that, in truth, there is no differentiation or separation as everything is still contained within absolute, unitive reality. Oneness is the only truth and the process of differentiating between what is good and what is not is like coming across milestones along that path. We differentiate in order to be content with the connectedness that leads to essential, original oneness. Human consciousness links the infinite unseen with finite sensory experiences.

These poems are like flags, held in a language of light brush strokes, indicating transitions between the boundless and the limited, within and beyond time and space, flying on a temple which reminds us of our transitory earthly journey and how magnificent it is if we are aware of timeless grace.  

This book is unique in that it has been narrated by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, so it carries a special timbre and resonance.

## Universal Qur’an

This is the age where we need regular spiritual recharge and awakening to the truth within our hearts.

The Noble Qur’an is universal and useful at all times and for all people. This belief motivated Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri to select the verses that are clearly universal. Shaykh Fadhlalla rendered the meanings of the verses in an easily accessible way for the modern reader. The verses selected are renderings of the inner meaning, rather than a traditional translation.

The present needs of human beings in this day and age require more reference to the Source of creation, and Divine Light – which are largely Meccan verses, of which this book presents a selection.

The selected verses help with personal transformation and the rise in consciousness and Universal Truth, rather than with relationship, community, law, and other aspects of conduct to help recharge spiritually.

The miracle of the Noble Qur’an is that its verses repeatedly reveal the seamless connection between the infinite, unseen, cosmic lights with finite, relative, and limited earthly consciousness. This selection of key verses is universally useful for all times and for all people for every moment in the human journey.

## The Tripod

The Tripod consists of:

1. **Be Accountable** 
    - Nothing is ever missed
    - Be Present
    - Be sure your actions are as good as your accountability.

2. **Witness everything that emerges as perfect**. Park your judgement and you will see the perfection of all. Things are as they are.

3. **Know that nothing in this existence ever goes unnoticed**. The _akhira_ is here and now. This life is merely a prelude, and independence is an illusion. There is nothing other than The One.

The Tripod brings you to the instant. The perfect infinitude of this moment. That is the springboard for the first talk.

> “Whatever you’re doing, know that it has equal and opposite cause and effect, action and reaction. Nothing ever escapes, so you need to be truly accountable, responsible, and aware that nothing ever is missed. So (be) present, present, present, in the moment. Do what you like to do, whatever you can do that’s helpful, but be sure that your action is as good as your accountability for people growing back to where they came from or to discover their own goals”.

Richard Eskow will interview Shaykh Fadhlalla who has agreed to unpack The Tripod over three sessions. This first session focused on being present and being accountable. You can catch up by clicking the link below.
