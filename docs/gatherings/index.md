## Universal Qur’an

<img src="/assets/images/uq.png" />

This is the age where we need regular spiritual recharge and awakening to the truth within our hearts.

The Noble Qur’an is universal and useful at all times and for all people. This belief motivated Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri to select the verses that are clearly universal. Shaykh Fadhlalla rendered the meanings of the verses in an easily accessible way for the modern reader. The verses selected are renderings of the inner meaning, rather than a traditional translation.

The present needs of human beings in this day and age require more reference to the Source of creation, and Divine Light – which are largely Meccan verses, of which this book presents a selection.

The selected verses help with personal transformation and the rise in consciousness and Universal Truth, rather than with relationship, community, law, and other aspects of conduct to help recharge spiritually.

The miracle of the Noble Qur’an is that its verses repeatedly reveal the seamless connection between the infinite, unseen, cosmic lights with finite, relative, and limited earthly consciousness. This selection of key verses is universally useful for all times and for all people for every moment in the human journey.  

This book will be discussed over two sessions, where Shaykh Saadi Shakur, Syed Haider Mehdi, and Dr. Adnan AlAdnani will engage with Shaykh Fadhlalla to discuss the 'wise commentary and rendering of these verses as a wake-up call for all humanity, regardless of belief or philosophy of life'.

**May 16 & 23, 2021**
12 PM Central African Time

### Special Broadcast for Eid ul Fitr

With the state of the COVID pandemic in South Africa and internationally we would highly recommend taking all necessary social distance precautions in doing the Eid ul Fitr Prayers. While these are best done as congregational prayers, we are giving our subscribers the option of doing this online. 

Eid ul Fitr in 2021 is a time of reflection, rejoicing, and gratitude. Ramadan 2021 has been a time to renew our commitment to service. Please ensure you give your Fitrah or set it aside which in South Africa is R48 & Fidayah R12 per member of your household before you commence your prayer.  

While traditionally we would start with prayers followed by a short sermon, this year we will start with a brief talk by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, followed by the prayer and a short Khutbah led by Imam Nusrah Cassiem. 

You can rewatch the Eid ul Fitr celebrations by clicking below:

This is the second session of a conversation between Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri and Amir Freimann. This session focuses on matters related to wholeness and love. Two most interesting subjects. This wonderful session is worth watching a number of times.

Please note that we had some minor technical matters which were resolved after the first five minutes of the broadcast. We apologise for this.
