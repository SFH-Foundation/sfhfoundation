## The Month of Ramadan 2021

The blessed month of Ramadan is upon us. We hope and pray this will be a month of healing, contemplation, and joy for all.   

Fasting is deeply rooted in our consciousness and a means of maintaining physical and mental health for cultural and political reasons. Fasting has been a devotional practice in most religious and spiritual movements through the ages. Islam has prescribed the practice of abstinence and fasting as a means of self-purification and worship. The act of restraining the self from fulfilling its desires purifies and enhances awareness physically, mentally, and spiritually and sensitizes human consciousness. The seeker realizes the weakness of the self and is gratified by the discipline, restriction, and prohibitions, for these limitations, are windows to Allah’s limitlessness. 

During this month we hope to have a series of events which we are pleased to announce. We will have some sessions from the Noble Quran with Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, Shaykh Saadi Shakur, and Dr. Adnan AlAdnani. In addition, we have some important conversations that we hope to have with Shaykh Kabir Helminski, Rick Archer, and other eminent scholars and renowned philosophers and teachers.

**Buddha at the Gas Pump Conversations with spiritually awakening people.**  

People everywhere are undergoing a shift to an Awakened state of consciousness which is transforming their understanding of themselves and the world. For some, this shift has been abrupt and dramatic. For others, it has been so gradual that they may not have realized it has occurred. Such shifts, or awakenings, are not new: Christ spoke of the Kingdom of Heaven within, Wahdat al-Wujud amongst the Sufis, Buddhists speak of Nirvana, Zen masters of Satori, Hindus of Moksha, but these traditions generally regard these states as rare and difficult to attain. Many people are therefore skeptical of claims of higher states of consciousness. They find it hard to believe that apparently ordinary friends and neighbors might be experiencing something extraordinary. Maybe they expect Enlightenment to look as remarkable on the outside as it is reputed to be on the inside. These videos enable ordinary people to share their experience of awakening.
