## Universal Qur’an

This is the age where we need regular spiritual recharge and awakening to the truth within our hearts.

The Noble Qur’an is universal and useful at all times and for all people. This belief motivated Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri to select the verses that are clearly universal. Shaykh Fadhlalla rendered the meanings of the verses in an easily accessible way for the modern reader. The verses selected are renderings of the inner meaning, rather than a traditional translation.

The present needs of human beings in this day and age require more reference to the Source of creation, and Divine Light – which are largely Meccan verses, of which this book presents a selection.

The selected verses help with personal transformation and the rise in consciousness and Universal Truth, rather than with relationship, community, law, and other aspects of conduct to help recharge spiritually.

The miracle of the Noble Qur’an is that its verses repeatedly reveal the seamless connection between the infinite, unseen, cosmic lights with finite, relative, and limited earthly consciousness. This selection of key verses is universally useful for all times and for all people for every moment in the human journey.

## The Tripod

The Tripod consists of:

1. **Be Accountable** 
    - Nothing is ever missed
    - Be Present
    - Be sure your actions are as good as your accountability.

2. **Witness everything that emerges as perfect**. Park your judgement and you will see the perfection of all. Things are as they are.

3. **Know that nothing in this existence ever goes unnoticed**. The _akhira_ is here and now. This life is merely a prelude, and independence is an illusion. There is nothing other than The One.

The Tripod brings you to the instant. The perfect infinitude of this moment. That is the springboard for the first talk.

> “Whatever you’re doing, know that it has equal and opposite cause and effect, action and reaction. Nothing ever escapes, so you need to be truly accountable, responsible, and aware that nothing ever is missed. So (be) present, present, present, in the moment. Do what you like to do, whatever you can do that’s helpful, but be sure that your action is as good as your accountability for people growing back to where they came from or to discover their own goals”.

Richard Eskow will interview Shaykh Fadhlalla who has agreed to unpack The Tripod over three sessions. This first session focused on being present and being accountable. You can catch up by clicking the link below.
