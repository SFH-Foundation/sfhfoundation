## The Month of Ramadan 2021

The blessed month of Ramadan is upon us. We hope and pray this will be a month of healing, contemplation, and joy for all.   

Fasting is deeply rooted in our consciousness and a means of maintaining physical and mental health for cultural and political reasons. Fasting has been a devotional practice in most religious and spiritual movements through the ages. Islam has prescribed the practice of abstinence and fasting as a means of self-purification and worship. The act of restraining the self from fulfilling its desires purifies and enhances awareness physically, mentally, and spiritually and sensitizes human consciousness. The seeker realizes the weakness of the self and is gratified by the discipline, restriction, and prohibitions, for these limitations, are windows to Allah’s limitlessness. 

During this month we hope to have a series of events which we are pleased to announce. We will have some sessions from the Noble Quran with Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, Shaykh Saadi Shakur, and Dr. Adnan AlAdnani. In addition, we have some important conversations that we hope to have with Shaykh Kabir Helminski, Rick Archer, and other eminent scholars and renowned philosophers and teachers.

### Special Broadcast for Eid ul Fitr

With the state of the COVID pandemic in South Africa and internationally we would highly recommend taking all necessary social distance precautions in doing the Eid ul Fitr Prayers. While these are best done as congregational prayers, we are giving our subscribers the option of doing this online. 

Eid ul Fitr in 2021 is a time of reflection, rejoicing, and gratitude. Ramadan 2021 has been a time to renew our commitment to service. Please ensure you give your Fitrah or set it aside which in South Africa is R48 & Fidayah R12 per member of your household before you commence your prayer.  

While traditionally we would start with prayers followed by a short sermon, this year we will start with a brief talk by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, followed by the prayer and a short Khutbah led by Imam Nusrah Cassiem. 

We will make a further announcement on the evening of May 12, 2021 as to when Eid ul Fitr will be celebrated on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHiMY_Scws1sB_bn84G-YXg" target="_blank">SFH Foundation YouTube Channel</a>.

The programme will start at Central African Time:

10:00 AM Call to Prayer by Imam Nusrah Cassiem<br/>
10:05 AM Introduction by Muna Haeri Bilgrami<br/>
10:08 AM Talk by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri<br/>
10:25 AM Prayer and Khutbah by Imam Nusrah Cassiem<br/>
Closing  

We would recommend that you do your prayers outside under the open sky and follow the prayer on your laptop or mobile device.

This is the second session of a conversation between Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri and Amir Freimann. This session focuses on matters related to wholeness and love. Two most interesting subjects. This wonderful session is worth watching a number of times.

Please note that we had some minor technical matters which were resolved after the first five minutes of the broadcast. We apologise for this.
