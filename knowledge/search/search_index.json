It had subsequently evolved over many millennia into the numerous complex forms of living beings we observe on earth, in sky and underwater. Human beings are naturally driven to explore, discover and know both what is obvious and that which is beyond. The human mind bridges the cosmic soul or spirit, with the self or individual identity. Every human being is a combination of a boundless and timeless divine soul and its shadow self which is bracketed between birth and death and structured around a physical body, brain and various faculties and organs. All human experiences are contained within opposite or complementary forces such as pleasure and pain, health and illness, sleep and wakefulness, and countless other attractions and repulsions. All of our experiences occur due to our mind and sensory faculties producing limited and conditioned consciousness which is just one kind of manifestation of boundless consciousness or divine presence. Our quest for freedom or liberation is an indication of our drive towards cosmic consciousness, which is both our origin and destiny. Evolution spanning millennia has resulted in the blueprint of Adamic Awakening. Living this blueprint means acknowledging how all visible terrestrial forces are due to the light of an all-encompassing celestial Reality which is the source of life. Normal human consciousness is balanced between what is desirable and what is not. We experience suffering and confusion as well as occasional contentment and joy. This is the nature of our temporary, limited consciousness on earth whose source is boundless, cosmic, and eternal. The notion of paradise on earth, or being godly, simply reflects the presence of a cosmic soul or spirit within the heart. Irrespective of circumstance, there is always hope which is transmitted from the sacred soul within. True contentment occurs when the earthly self calibrates with the perfect state of the heavenly soul. Balance Our world is out of balance in that earthly consciousness is excessively emphasized leading to a culture of fear and distraction, which hampers any attempt to integrate self and soul and thereby awaken to truth. The nature of the inner soul is that of heavenly paradise and the nature of its shadowy lower self is darkness and uncertainty. When conditioned consciousness leaves the temporal life of duality, it touches upon the higher zone of full consciousness which is ever permanent and glorious. By reason and rationality we may reduce our outer confusions and ignorance, but only by complete transcendence of mind and personal identity will we touch upon the zone of perpetual light emanating from the soul within a purified heart. This website attempts to make accessible the great classical teachings which have emerged from scripture, world religions and prophetic revelations \u2013 especially the Quran, which is a magnificent distillation of previous declarations. This universal path can enable people, at any period of time or geographic location, to live as decent human beings celebrating life on earth as a prelude and preparation for the next stage of full awakening, which \u2013 in most cases \u2013 occurs after death. What unites all human beings is the genuine drive towards awakening to the ever-present and prevailing truth of oneness, veiled behind numerous dualities, pluralities and mental differentiations. Personal or communal calamities, or catastrophic fear, is tempered and reduced when recalibrated with the eternal truth of perpetual life from which all emerged. To save one\u2019s self from the lower self and its shadow play, we need to connect our personal life diligently and intelligently to the eternal life beyond the limitations of time and space. We need to unify \u2013 by effort, prayers, and meditation \u2013 the celestial and the terrestrial within us. Only then can you live cheerfully with your transience, alive to the knowledge of the soul\u2019s permanency. Being on earth as a heavenly reality.","title":"The Human Story"},{"location":"#the-human-story","text":"","title":"The Human Story"},{"location":"#from-darkness-to-light","text":"Life on earth emerged a long time ago as simple awareness, driven by the desire to perpetuate itself.

The Academy of Self Knowledge delivers a range of dynamic courses, workshops and seminars in the journey of self-discovery. Universal, soul- stirring questions are addressed, such as: What is happiness? Does my life have a purpose? How can I find harmony in my relationships? What does it mean to be in connection with my soul? Is it possible to live joyfully in today\u2019s world? Founded in 2003 by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, ASK offers key principles which give us an insight into who we truly are, what motivates us and what hinders us from living our best life. Once we have been given these maps of the self, the challenge then lies in how to lead our lives in an optimal way that supports our growing consciousness. We are often aware of the desire to maintain our spiritual values, but find it difficult to navigate our way in a world that feels challenging. Unlike most courses, the ASK program not only gives you the knowledge base but also realistic applications by which you will experience real transformation in your life, building on the premise that knowledge alone is not power, but that applied knowledge has the power to transform. What ASK offers We offer \"maps of truth that will illumine the journey in this life and the hereafter\". The Academy has developed bespoke packages of learning that meet the requirements of specific groups and organizational needs. Currently we regularly run two types of intensive courses, either over a few months or over full weekend workshops. Both of these are highly participative, interactive and self-reflective to deepen one\u2019s understanding of our own real life experiences.

For instance, you can find talks on this topic across our archives, like: Human Consciousness which covers consciousness as we experience it in day-to-day life. Abstention Fasting which is a two-part series that goes into detail about how such practices can lead to experiencing higher consciousness. Descriptive Prescriptive Qur'an which is a four-part series that deals, in part, with Qur'anic descriptions of the phenomena and prescriptions for aligning with it optimally. There are also many videos we have provided on this broad topic, the most directly relevant of which is the two part series From Darkness to Light which discusses both the two zones of consciousness that form a major tenet within the Shaykh's teaching, as well as a full-length talk offering invaluable keys to an awakened life. In the selection below, we offer you various excerpts from some of Shaykh Fadhlalla's books produced over the years to lead you in considering for yourself what you make of this most important phenomena and experience. Why? Every why is an attempt to connect. Why do we love light? It connects us with the surrounding area and enables us to move and act more efficiently. Why do we love? In order to connect more deeply. Why do you want to hear someone's voice or meet him or her? Why do you want to connect? In order to widen your knowledge and conscious experience. Why do you continue? Because the light of the soul within you is eternal. Every why comes back to one of three roots: to increase consciousness , through connectedness , and continuity . The whys will eventually lead to the domain of Oneness. It is the divine trick to reveal itself - eternally present but veiled. A question is the mental excuse needed to receive the gift of the answer that was already begging the question. Who Is In Control? As long as anything moves, its destiny and existence are uncertain. Nature provided a suitable environment for life and consciousness to emerge within the confines of the womb of space and time - that is the history of life on earth. However that limited cosnciousness is charged by permanent consciousness, by sacred beingness. From this emerges a short-lived human life dependent always on eternal life. All is under Soul-control, but we are veiled by the ability to move and change. You can close the door or leave it open. You can leave this place or not. Speak or be silent. Limited, limited, limited. We are given a tiny opening to visualize the infinite, self-propelled universe, which is under perfect governance at all times. Human life is like a waiting room before we perceive the reality of perfect control, by One who permeates it all. Calibration Frustrations arise out of the disparity between our higher Soul consciousness and the shadow self. How can we refer and calibrate our perceived experience with the constancy of the soul? It is helpful to have a role model, and more helpful to have a trusted teacher who reflects higher consciousness. The zone of higher consciousness is infinite and beyond all descriptions like joy, bliss or happiness. A good example of how to move to higher consciousness is riding a bicycle. You are put on the saddle and somebody pushes you. After a while you learn to balance and you feel you can repeat it on your own. Similarly, you first need a map of Reality, and you then follow the path that may lead to your destination. Continuity We often experience disappointment. We also too often feel trapped, confused or lost. Why are we constantly faced with these challenges? This is due to the limitations of conditioned consciousness and ego. Between birth and death, we play roles in this shadow theatre of life, as we evolve towards our origin. However, while birth and death form another complimentary pair of opposites, something withis us knows that life continues forever. The Soul, or ruh , is not subject to space and time, nor beginnings and endings which exist within it. Determination and grace are required to awaken to your Soul. It is when you experience that ever-present Reality, you know that your old self was merely a shadow, of the Real. When you transcend your tyrannical or feral self, you perceive that its role was to cause that suffering and thereby act as a prelude for awakening. Your lower self leads you to your real self \u2013 the divine spirit within. Life on earth is a struggle because it is a realm of experience between limitations and limitless Reality. You need help and a guiding hand. You need a reference. You need Grace and perception of the sacred presence. Sleepwalkers The herd mentality, collective consciousness and love of tradition are common conditions of most people. Old cultures and ingrained bonds, including religion, language and life habits, are barriers to change. So are self-concern and the obsession with survival. This renders most people tunnel-visioned, acting as sleepwalkers. Minds are occupied, bodies act like robots and hearts are dark. The people of Rome were surrounded by fire and most did not feel the urgency to evacuate. The unfortunate voyagers on the Titanic believed in the unsinkable ship and the orchestra continued playing. The love for continuity can override signals and signs of dangers. Sleepwalkers, like zombies, do not read signs or messages. No human being is spared from nature\u2019s generosity and from the shocks in life to wake us up to a higher level of consciousness and soul awareness. Dreams From ancient times the idea of what is real and what is not has challenged human thought. There are different zones of consciousness, as there are different realities. During our wakeful state, we consider most sharable experiences as real, but what is real about a dream? A healthy working relationship between our senses, mind and heart develop to reconcile the ever-changing evolving self and the constant soul. We link physics and metaphysics, our sensory reality and Reality. Dreams and sleep are essential for human health \u2013 to reorder, fit and connect day-to-day experiences and past memory, and enable our temporary life to be nourished by the soul\u2019s light. The enlightened being regards all normal experiences as a dream. Common dreams are merely dreams within a dream. The Aware Heart All human endeavours that increase knowledge, ability, efficiency and wholseomeness imply a journey towards higher consciousness. Life begins with basic sentiency and ends with spontaneous awareness of awareness. The arrow of time moves from 'no-thingness' towards absolute Oneness. Worship can be ragarded as an evolutionary spiritual exercise to transcend the mind and come into unison with the divine soul within. Ultimat eliberation and enlightenment implies taking constant reference from the immutable soul. In a sacred tradition Allah declares that: The Heavens and Earth do not contain Me, but the heart of he who believes contains Me.\" Every heart contains a soul and the potential to realize that truth is open to all. The Nature of Existence The Universe emerged from a mysterious singularity which is incomprehensible to us. Whatever is known and unknown was at origin an intense togetherness, connectedness, inseparability and oneness. With the emergence of space and time, every type of form and energy emerged in pairs and pluralities. Whatever we discern has its complementary opposite, inseparable from it. Two\u2019s are disguised expressions of the One. Oneness is beyond all values and differentiation, whereas in duality there cannot be any goodness without the seed of badness. Personal life is accompanied by death and light is discerned due to darkness. All dualities have their root in the original Oneness to which they return \u2014 the Perpetual One.","title":"Consciousness"},{"location":"articles/consciousness/#consciousness-an-overview","text":"The question of what really constitues consciousness has been addressed in many different ways, and multiple different formats by Shaykh Fadhlalla over the years.

A healthy working relationship between our senses, mind and heart develop to reconcile the ever-changing evolving self and the constant soul. We link physics and metaphysics, our sensory reality and Reality. Dreams and sleep are essential for human health \u2013 to reorder, fit and connect day-to-day experiences and past memory, and enable our temporary life to be nourished by the soul\u2019s light.

Pleasure and Happiness From the book \" The Mercy of Qur\u2019an and The Advent of Zaman \u2013 Tafsir of Surat Ankabut, Rahman, Waqi\u00e1, Mulk \" A pleasure is something one can share, one can buy. It is related to attachment and is a worldly thing while surur , joy, is for its own sake. The bird sings because its nature is to sing, irrespective of whether the hunter is hunting it or the neighborhood is giving it extra food. A pleasure is a result of something that has occurred. A person is lonely, then he meets a companion who echoes much of what he believes in \u2013 that is a pleasure. Someone was hungry, there was emptiness in his stomach and it was filled with food \u2013 that is a pleasure. Pleasure is like neutralization: the negative and the positive meet and are neutralized. Joy is something else; it is the negation of the negative. Joy occurs when what was considered to be desirable has been recognized as being wahm , illusion. Negation of the negative is positive and that is the normal state of man. It is for this reason that man inherently seeks joy. He knows pleasure, he knows it is purchasable, but he does not readily know the way to joy. Man seeks happiness because it is his real nature. He is unhappy because he has been telling himself that he needs a certain something to be happy. He constantly runs after it, but as soon as he gets it, he desires something else. The door to the abode of joy is the recognition of how to unknot what one has knotted. That is why it is said that the source is a secret within a secret. A desirable thing is in itself a wahm . The recognition of the wahm is the negation of it. And if the negation is genuine, then the root of joy is being nourished from within. That is the soil in which the tree of contentment will grow. Contentment is a tree that nobody can transplant into anybody else. One has to, through one\u2019s own labor, nurture it and make it grow. \u2018You\u2019 Are The Outer And The Inner From the book \u201c Calling Allah By His Most Beautiful Names \u201d We can talk of three realms of unity, which relate to the zones of action, attribute and essence. Action and manifestation are based on causality, reasoning and intellect. The reflective believer will soon discover that all experiences are balanced by their opposites. There is no pleasure without displeasure, no health without illness, and the root of these realities lies in their opposite. Higher attributes reflect the divine qualities and are most desirable for us as they are doors to inner happiness. Essence is the indiscernible and hidden root \u2013 the Light of lights. When one is illumined, the state of excellence ( ihs\u0101n ) is experienced and tasted. Then the All-Merciful appears and you will see His light in every situation. As life in our discernible world is based on action, it means we live with constant change; hence we are always seeking a reliable zone of reference so that we can understand change and deal with it with a sense of priority. We may desire a beautiful object, for example, but it can deteriorate and become ugly in time or under certain circumstances. Thus, what we really desire is the attribute of beauty, and not the object itself. The realm of attributes is subtler than that of the realm of action and manifestation. Even subtler is the essence of Allah which is hidden in His attributes, which themselves are behind the actions and manifestations of physical existence. Therefore, witnessing and understanding the unity of action and manifestation comes before realising the unity of attributes, all of which meet in the one essence. The Prophet (pbuh) said: \u201cI take refuge in Your forgiveness from Your punishment [unity of actions] and I take refuge in Your mercy from Your anger [unity of attributes] and I take refuge in You from You [unity of essence] Oh Lord, do not let me rely upon myself, not even for a blink of an eye.\u201d Its meaning is that there is only \u2018You\u2019 behind all that appears, and within all that there is. \u2018You\u2019 are the outer and the inner.","title":"The Cycles of Life and Reality"},{"location":"articles/cycles-life-reality/#cycles-of-life-and-reality","text":"We experience numerous spheres of cycles and zones of consciousness with natural beginnings and ends.

Decrees are the rules which define life\u2019s experiences on earth. Most of these rules are describable or measurable, especially those dealing with the visible realities. The rules that govern all aspects of physical (visible and experiential) existence combine with those that control the unseen forces to form a network that will result in, for example, the laws of physics. We can describe the phenomenon of light, for instance, as both a wave and a particle called a photon. The rules somehow emerge from an unknown domain into describable, measurable, physical laws. So the decrees can be seen as a series of multitudinous models by means of which the creation, seen and unseen, is held together. Destiny is the final occurrence that is experienced by the individual through the passage of time, when these laws are enacted. It is when a describable event has already passed through time. The concept of destiny is also parallel in Arabic to another term \u2019ajal , which signifies \u2018appointed time, date, deadline, instant of death, respite, delay\u2019. If we say a business partnership has an \u2018ajal of five years, it means that at the end of this period it will have reached its full destiny, which is dissolution. The final destiny of every man is his awakening to his permanent, non-time reality, from which he has emerged. We are given the experience of this life, with all its decrees, for us to know them, accept them and become one with them so that we can see our destiny within them, and our destiny beyond them, when time stops at the point of death. Through the discipline of meditative practices, time can be experienced as coming to a stop. Whilst we fear death we love and are dependent on deep sleep, which is the nearest experience to death. If we are able to experience the mini-death of inner contemplation, we stand a good chance of realizing that our true reality, the Source of the cause behind existence, is eternal and ever present. It is only the body that dies, while the soul or spirit continues into perpetuity. As we are all programmed to dislike fear, the universal fear of death betrays the true meaning of death. It is only an experiential barrier that demarcates a natural discrimination by returning the body to where it belongs, and by returning the soul to whence it originally emanated from in the zone of eternal consciousness. So the fact that we do not like death reveals a certain measure of its falsehood as a termination of life. It is in fact a process of segregation. The confusion is due to identifying with the body and mind rather than the soul within. It is only the body that dies; for it has been the vehicle for the development of the self, whose proper schooling lies in the melting pot of the world of duality, whilst yearning for the knowledge of the One from whom it emanated in the first place. The human destiny is potentially the highest of known creations \u2013 as was our beginning. We start life with a basic level of existence and are driven to reach the highest levels of consciousness and experiences. Enlightenment is to know the perfection and reliability of God\u2019s plan; with reflection and wisdom we realize that human will is a very small factor in contentment and sustained happiness. Spiritual wisdom leads to witnessing the utter perfection of the instant and abandonment to the moment. Then we come to understand the truth that abundance is available at all times to everyone. This is the final awakening to the state of Oneness. We are brought into time in order that we may face the incredible, unfathomable, never-ending non-time.

The Path lies in dhikr , fikr and himmah . Dhikr is the remembrance of God, from whom I am separated by my self. It is this illusion that is caused by me that is the cause of this barrier, separation. So it is a process of elimination. If I overcome the self, if I remove all of these images, all of these goggles that I have erroneously put on, then I am bound to be less separated from that which is the source of all beingness. So remembrance is necessary for us to begin to dissolve the self. If I remember God at the moment of agitation and disappointment, if I remember the Creator of the entire cosmos, from Whom this life is allotted for a few years, then my own little misery, my own problem, put in the large perspective, is bound to gain a measure of relief. It is bound to be a remedy for whatever situation I am in. Remembrance begins as an outside activity. Then it belongs to the heart. How can I remember God when I am full of me? When the bucket is full of me, there is no room for anything else. It is a displacement process. A bucket of pure water with mud particles in suspension can be purified again if we place it under a tap which drips into it fresh clear water. In time, this bucket of mud begins to get cleaner and cleaner and begins to reflect more of its real nature of pure water. Our nature is that of purity. That is why we like purity \u2013 we are basically pure at source. So there is no room for personal guilt. Our heritage is purity and the simplicity of beingness. But, because of the activities which we undertake in the world, we begin to solidify the roles and images into a personality with apparently conflicting and often irreconcilable aspects. It is by remembrance of God that I can begin to melt down the layers that I have created which are the source of my agitation, problems, and expectations. It is the most vital activity. A muslim prays five times a day, five formal and definable times for dhikr and salat (prayer). Five times to remember and submit to Allah, outwardly and inwardly. Fikr is that light which is shed on a scene in order to discriminate: what is good and what is bad, what is lasting and what is not, right and wrong, black and white. If we are in a state of real remembrance, then discrimination will operate spontaneously. Suppose we stop the moving film of our actions and freeze a frame. Dhikr freezes the \u2018frame\u2019 of action and fikr shines the torch of discrimination on it. Subsequent correct action will result from this. The film shows that I disliked your presence here to such an extent that I proceeded to punch you, and all of a sudden I see myself in this childish act, in the frozen shot of this film. If I catch myself in that instant, I am bound to discriminate and immediately correct the course. But we are often slow, and leave it too late. After I have done it I plead for forgiveness and say, \u2018It wasn\u2019t me!\u2019 What this means is that, after the event, I have had a replay of the act, because it was fresh in my memory, and in the light of discrimination. Neither remembrance nor discrimination will occur unless there is himmah \u2013 energy, yearning to be true, full, alive. The more we have this energy, the more it becomes available. It is like tapping a source: the more you clean the head of the spring, the more clear water will flow. But because we are accustomed to living in a manner that is totally incorrect and harmful, and which we try to persevere, we are scared of change and shut ourselves up in our private rooms. It is because we want to persevere habits. We are afraid of opening our hands to drop the thorns which we have clasped and made ours. But, when the pain is deep and real, then great yearning will enable us to act, drop the thorns and find the freedom that was there to begin with anyway. You may ask, \u2018if it is so easy, then what are all these methods for?\u2019 In a way, it is like picking up new thorns at will in order to get rid of the thorn that has been aching in you all these years \u2013 the old self. So there must be a beginning. The extent of new speed of the raft, floating on the stream of the past, depends entirely on the extent of the new energy in you. The greater the yearning and burning, the greater the energy. The greater is your suffering, the more you are qualified to free yourself from it. When fear is mild, one can brush it aside. When it is vast, new basic treatment is necessary and final cure is more probable. So the three basic requirements of the Path are entirely interrelated. Each of them reinforces the others, both in quantity and quality. If I have greater awareness, then more discrimination will constantly illuminate my actions. Therefore, more of my new actions will be such that they are not likely to enhance the self in me. Slowly, one observes the vanishing \u2018I\u2019-ness: arrogance, vanity, personality. So the outcome of the path towards self-knowledge is getting rid of the impermanent. Get rid of the \u2018I\u2019 and you will see the real self. It is a process of elimination.

May every instant of our lives be full of joyful optimism so that we progress from one level of understanding and inner light to a higher one, until such time there is nothing left for us to do in this world other than to remain in the ecstasy of truly saying, knowing, singing \"la ilaha illallah\" ! I would like to share with you the origin of this Eid celebration. We love to celebrate, to be in a state of positive expectation, to be generous, intelligent and courageous. So we celebrate the Eid in order for us to return to the original condition of our father Adam in the Garden. This state of consciousness is within our soul and needs to be recalled by transcending our earth bound identity. Life on this Earth is a prelude to a return to the Garden from where Adam, Hawa and all of us \u2013 as children of Adam \u2013 came from. On earth we are constantly challenged with dualities and choices. We seek the best continuously. This life of ours on earth is only a practice to return back to the Garden. This is why we love beautiful, tranquil, earthly gardens with water and flowers. Unlike these gardens, the original Garden is forever. It does not change. The Qur\u2019an mentions that for all those who are in cautious awareness and remembrance, paradise is close by. We move after this month of restriction back to normality. We only need to restrict a little of the outer in order to increase on the inner. The wonderful experiences during the month of fasting enable us to access a higher zone of consciousness and boundlessness. The word Eid appears only once in the Qur\u2019an, in Surah Ma\u00b4idah . It is the story of the sincere followers of the Prophet Isa. They ask him: \"Can\u2019t you bring upon us from the unseen a banquet or a meal, or some nourishment? We want to taste of it so that our hearts become completely certain that all of it is from Allah.\" So Isa asks his Lord to bring down a heavenly banquet \u2013 an Eid , not only for those who came first but also for those of later time. We always quest the proof of the connection between the seen and the unseen, as our soul is heavenly but living on earth. This is the meaning of Eid . The Arabic root is aada , \u2018to have returned\u2019. Return to what? All of us, who have fasted, tend to return once more towards over indulgence. This is not an interesting return. What is worthwhile to return to is the original condition of Adam in the Garden. We need to move towards that Eid . A day in which you are constantly aware of Allah\u2019s presence with you is an Eid . So every instant can be an Eid , meaning a return back to the original state that we aspire for. We are here to interact in this world without being overwhelmed by it. This knowledge is liberating. Our worldly existence is not a prison. It can be a path towards the ultimate liberated perfection. Space and time will no longer hold us down as happens in our normal consciousness. We want to do things fast and go beyond the speed of light. We want to do everything instantly, so that we are close to that state of constant, timeless perfection. This is our original nature. This is where we came from, and this is where we are all struggling to return to. Our path is based on grooming the self. Once you have realised that the lower self is of no consequence it can lead you to your higher self. The lower self is only an ego, ever changing, ever treacherous, and you can only recognise its shadows and darkness because of the divine light in you. You, then, recognize that you are often frightened, often greedy, that you are ignorant about what comes after death and are scared of it. Once you taste this knowledge you realise you are a soul. Every one of us desires the same thing. Beyond what we see as troubles and difficulties there is a most just Creator, whose order is within us. No matter the individual level of knowledge, education, spiritual understanding and awakening, we all have the same potential. All of us have a soul, which is a spark from the original sacred light of Allah. We all have a divine treasure in our heart.Once we realise that our source of inspiration and connection to Allah \u2013 our soul \u2013 lies within us, we can rise to the true original Adamic worshipfulness. Allah will guide everybody how best to worship. All we need to do is to stop our lower self. This is all what we can do. We have no control over the soul. So this is why it all begins with \"la ilaha illallah\" . Eid is about arrival. It is about returning to where we have emanated from, returning to the state that we yearn for. The little outer garden is a sample of the eternal Garden, whose pattern lies within our hearts.","title":"Eid - The Return"},{"location":"articles/eid/#eid-the-return","text":"The following is an extract from an Eid Talk given by Shaykh Fadhalla Haeri. May every instant of our lives be full of joyful optimism so that we progress from one level of understanding and inner light to a higher one, until such time there is nothing left for us to do in this world other than to remain in the ecstasy of truly saying, knowing, singing \"la ilaha illallah\" ! I would like to share with you the origin of this Eid celebration. We love to celebrate, to be in a state of positive expectation, to be generous, intelligent and courageous. So we celebrate the Eid in order for us to return to the original condition of our father Adam in the Garden. This state of consciousness is within our soul and needs to be recalled by transcending our earth bound identity.

No matter what we look at in existence, we find that it can always be traced back to its one original source, Allah. Recognising the One Existent Creator while we live in this world of multiple forms is essential for our well-being. Without such a unitive recognition and awareness, we tend to fluctuate between being disturbed and tranquil. Like the pilgrimage to Makka, journey of transformation requires letting go all of one\u2019s assumptions. All links with the past must be cut, irrespective of culture and identity. We cannot deny that the past has happened; its benefits could continue to unfold in innumerable ways. However, if we succeed in letting go, of not making comparisons or clinging to what we imagine will give us happiness, our minds will be more alert to the moment. Our hearts will also be empty of negative feelings such as fear, greed and jealousy. Then we will be transformed. People often say that they find it hard to give up their attachments. Those who hang on to their material possessions, habits, and ideas must stop to think: what is it that they feel they have to give up? What promises were they given in the womb? Nothing belongs to us. We merely borrow certain minerals and other matter that constitute the body from the earth, in order for us to journey from the unseen, interact with creation, and to return to the unseen with the light of knowledge that Allah has provided for us. Created to reside for a short while in the darkness in the womb, we emerge, encompassed by the Light that enables us to see sunlight, as well as the darkness of numerous shadows. This is the path of discovery. Without embarking on this journey we have no hope of entering the city of knowledge that lies unconquered within us from before time. Transformation is possible if the prescription is correct and applied with care. Here we enter an altogether new state which, if maintained, leads to a station of being that encompasses and transcends our humanity. Allah says in the Qur\u2019an that He will not change people unless they change themselves. This applies to each individual and to society. Indeed, if we start by changing the individual, we will end up with a changed society. Only when we arrive at the true knowledge of our origin can we hope to serve society. Attempting to serve others before having arrived at such knowledge will only project our inner confusion onto others. If, however, we return to our original station of fusion, of being completely integrated in our knowledge of the outer and the inner, the seen and the unseen, then we may be of some use to the rest of mankind. Once we arrive at the real knowledge that is already contained within us, we find that we are constantly circling the inner Ka\u2019ba that symbolises the believer\u2019s heart, and which is seen to be the seat of all truth. This perpetual, spontaneous awareness puts us in a constant state of jih\u0101d (striving) and purifies our intentions. We learn to face ourselves with honesty and question whether we are serving others with expectation of reward or praise. Do we recognise that what we are giving to others, in terms of material wealth or a service, is from the very Source of giving, mercy and generosity? Or is it instead an act that will merely gratify our egos, based on enhancing our reputations or our society, or to impose the glitter of our knowledge on others? The ability to do this is a great blessing. It is a remarkable gift to be able to give to others what does not, in any case, belong to us. We only have it on loan from our Creator. If we make ourselves completely neutral by giving up the past and our attachments while keeping ourselves open to inspiration, coupled with willingness to undertake appropriate work, then we are true wayfarers on the path of unity. This is positive action. It is not the occurrence of some fantastic or miraculous event; the miracle is life itself. The prophet \u2018Isa (Jesus) came at a time when people were fascinated by healing and so Allah gave him the ultimate power of healing \u2013 that of raising the dead. Our age, however, has moved past the phenomenological, to a time when cognition and incisive intellect dominate. The time of Buddha was a time of only \u1e25aq\u012bqa, of light, but now we need boundaries to deal with the darkness of modernism, with its enslavement by monetarism. We cannot resurrect the past. We need instead to dig inside ourselves to discover the origin of human consciousness, the inner cosmos, and so discover the complete prophetic teaching \u2026 There is only one journey, and every prophet from Adam, through the hundreds whose names are not known, to Prophet Muhammad, bore the same message of Isl\u0101m, which means submission to this all-encompassing reality.

We may feel secure and content regarding an aspect of our life and yet at the same time apprehensive or insecure regarding something else. Even when one feels upbeat and happy there lurks a shade of sadness, due to the temporariness of this state. There is a subconscious fear of loss of the pleasurable moment as we have already experienced previous mood swings. No \u2018mental\u2019 state or feelings is ever lost. The swing between contentment and the desires continue. Normal day-to-day human life contains countless illusions partly sensed and partly imagined or anticipated. The so-called \u2018real\u2019 life experiences are a result of a combination of subjective and objective factors, which in fact include fears, fantasies and wishful thinking. The ever-changing state of personal consciousness is dependent upon pure consciousness that permeates all existence. This sphere of constancy and wholeness engulfs and energises all lesser levels of consciousness. Conditioned consciousness drives us to pursue whatever ensures survival, strength and growth and a host of other earthly needs. We naturally delude ourselves into pursuing extra desires and ideas superfluous to survival and basic stability. For example, love for wealth or power may relate to satisfying needs for physical survival and social status up to a point. Similarly body chemistry drives us towards sexual gratification and procreation but it often becomes a means to stimulate mental \u2018reward\u2019 chemistry. Through the power of hunger we are driven to act and know how and where to discover food and shelter. Ultimately, the drive to satisfy worldly needs leads to higher and subtler states of harmony and wellbeing at the levels of body, mind and heart. Spiritual wisdom is the realization that on its own the self/ego can never attain perfection or happiness. It is by transcending all illusions and so-called realities that we awaken to the ever-present Real. When the outer challenges lead to inner transformation, the joys of unity overflow beyond all that is seen and unseen. Natural Illusions. Nature can be deceptive in many ways and at different levels of subtlety or obviousness. Rainbow colours appear to reveal the vibrant components of light, yet there is a far boarder range of frequencies and wavelengths in light than we can visibly discern. The common assumption is that light is what enables us to see; the rest of the story eludes us. For example, birds have learned many ways to distract potential threats from their nests. Often the male bird acts as a decoy while the female lays still on the eggs, blending in with her surroundings; a trick which gives birds an advantage in order to survive. In fact, nature is full of deceptions and illusions. Consciousness is the foundation of life that connects the unseen with the seen through light. Without light there would be neither energy nor the physical world. Our apparent world hides numerous levels of subtler forces, which are barely discernible or describable. Logic and causality are keys in describing what appears to us as real, but what is not apparent is of much greater magnitude, like the bulk of the hidden iceberg. Consciousness is subtler than light and is at the root of existence and creation. There are countless ways of looking at consciousness and differentiating between its levels, spheres and spectrums. Two spheres stand out clearly, however. First is the basic level that makes human beings sentient and alive. This basic consciousness is the face behind the will to survive, grow, replicate, and so on. All living entities are energized by this consciousness. Human beings are distinct from other creatures due to a greater sphere of consciousness, which is higher consciousness, God-consciousness, supreme consciousness or soul consciousness. To this level belong all higher attributes and virtues such as mercy, generosity, forgiveness and others. Human ethics and morality evolve due to higher consciousness. To be like an animal at first is quite natural, but not to evolve and realize higher consciousness signifies an unfulfilled life. Every creation reaches its appropriate destiny when its highest potential (in terms of consciousness) is accomplished. God is the essence of universal supreme consciousness. For a child it is natural and normal to be selfish and concerned mostly with its own physical sensory needs. With maturity comes the quest for a sustainable fulfilled life. The lights of higher consciousness begin to supersede the early \u2018survival\u2019 consciousness. To remain mainly bound to conditioned consciousness is to be deprived of awakening to the one real potential of soul essence. Our animalistic state of existence reinforces itself through multiple delusions, veils and worldly distractions, which divert us from accessing soul-consciousness. If we look closely at all these paradoxes and illusions, we see that they were in fact appropriate for us at a particular time or situation in this world, like the shell that protects the kernel of a nut. That is why it is said that there is goodness in everything that exists \u2013 if only we look with the eye of spiritual discernment. It is context and specific causality that needs to be viewed. A poison can kill and can cure. Egotism is essential in a child but out of season in a grown up and even detrimental. Everything in nature reveals some aspects of itself and hides others. Everything earthly has also a heavenly aspect and every lie betrays an aspect of truth. To progress spiritually we need to witness naturally occurring illusions, assumptions and fallacies and break past them to the essence that is eternally constant and perfect.","title":"Natural Illusions"},{"location":"articles/natural-illusions/#illusions","text":"By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, from the book \u201c101 Helpful Illusions\u201d","title":"Illusions"},{"location":"articles/natural-illusions/#personal-illusions","text":"Life\u2019s numerous paradoxes, enigmas and apparent contradictions can be resolved when we consider the human being as a balanced composition between the self (conditioned basic consciousness) and a soul (pure consciousness).

That is why it is said that there is goodness in everything that exists \u2013 if only we look with the eye of spiritual discernment. It is context and specific causality that needs to be viewed. A poison can kill and can cure. Egotism is essential in a child but out of season in a grown up and even detrimental. Everything in nature reveals some aspects of itself and hides others. Everything earthly has also a heavenly aspect and every lie betrays an aspect of truth. To progress spiritually we need to witness naturally occurring illusions, assumptions and fallacies and break past them to the essence that is eternally constant and perfect.","title":"Natural Illusions."},{"location":"articles/parable-spider/","text":"The Parable of the Spider's House Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri from the book \u201cThe Mercy of Qur\u2019an and The Advent of Zaman Tafsir of Surat Ankabut, Rahman, Waqi\u00e1, Mulk\u201d \u201cThe parable of those who take guardians besides Allah is like the parable of the spider that spins for itself a house.

The spider\u2019s web is exposed to the elements of nature: heat, cold, wind and rain. In fact, the web does not protect the spider from anything, as its main function is to provide the spider with insects for food. It is the least secure, and the least stable, of structures. Any human being who believes he or she is stable, or secure materially or socially in terms of habits or habitat, is dwelling on as flimsy a premise as the spider\u2019s web. One\u2019s attachments, phobias and habits are as secure as the wisp of thought that repeatedly brings them about. The ultimate refuge is with Allah. Man takes refuge in Allah when he pursues the knowledge of Reality by realizing that everything other than Allah is relative and unsatisfactory, like the house of the spider. When the wind or rain comes, the web often breaks apart. By taking refuge in Allah, man leaves what is relative and insecure and orientates himself towards what he knows to be reliable and permanent. He migrates from ignorance to knowledge. The closer he comes to knowledge of Allah the more he discovers the relativity of everything else. Discrimination and wisdom enable him to interact correctly with the laws governing existence. He finds them simple to deal with and therefore has little trouble with what is existentially necessary. The natural way to familiarize oneself with the laws of existence is to step out of one\u2019s self-made spider\u2019s web, the barriers and veils that a person has woven around his heart, considering them to be important. If one leaves all of that, the heart has no connection to illusions and its functioning becomes natural. One who finds that he has become too attached to a place or situation will feel as though his heart has been stripped from him when that place or situation disappears. It is usually false imagination and habits. The spider leaves the torn web behind and spins another one with little trouble. Man, however, will weep and blame bad luck. With consciousness one can become aware of this affliction; one becomes conscious of being conscious.

Reflecting upon creation is one of the highest actions one can perform in this existence. Prayer, fasting, and all the other pillars of the life-transaction (din) are helpful in the same way as the structure and foundation of a house are helpful to its occupant. Living in the house joyfully is the ultimate purpose, and this is attained by deep reflection. The best time for reflection is when one has been jolted, when one\u2019s web has been torn away from its support, which is itself flimsy and transient. Observing the lives of the prophets and the great ones, one finds that they were afflicted to the limit of endurance; but because of their proximity to Allah, outer events did not affect their inner blessing and joy.","title":"The Parable of the Spider\u2019s House"},{"location":"articles/parable-spider/#the-parable-of-the-spiders-house","text":"Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri from the book \u201cThe Mercy of Qur\u2019an and The Advent of Zaman Tafsir of Surat Ankabut, Rahman, Waqi\u00e1, Mulk\u201d \u201cThe parable of those who take guardians besides Allah is like the parable of the spider that spins for itself a house.

We always hope to discover answers to our day-to-day questions as well as the big questions in life. How did life begin? How and when will life end? Who am I really? Who are you? What is the purpose of life? Philosophical people often answer that it is to know Truth or God. What is that? We are often told that we have duties and responsibilities in this life. What are these and what is their purpose? What is truth and where is it? What is real and constant? Will we ever know the truth in this life? Life, Death and Change Several religions say that everyone will know the truth after death. In that case, where is God\u2019s love and generosity in this world? At all times we seek to avoid pain, fear and sorrow, yet no one is ever spared these experiences in varying intensity and duration. We all want to live a fulfilled and happy life, yet we are unlikely to meet anyone who has successfully attained that state durably. Why do we experience ever-changing feelings and moods? Much of life\u2019s experiences can be pleasant and desirable yet there are numerous events that cause grief, pain and misery. How can we experience and enjoy the highest quality of life? How can we maintain a healthy balance in body, mind and heart? What is the purpose of religion and spiritual aspiration? Why is it that nothing ever gives us sustained contentment? What is it that we are really striving to achieve? What sort of life do we experience, if any, after death? Life on earth is due to the interplay between energy and matter within space and time. Basic life began a few hundred million years ago, giving rise to human consciousness as we experience it now. There are two sides to human nature. One has evolved over millions of years and contains traces of all that exists on earth. The other side of our composition is a celestial bundle of lights and energies often named as spirit or soul. This celestial life source is our real nature which we long for \u2013 the God within. The development of our personality and conditioned consciousness takes place in this dynamic of an animal self confined within space and time, and energised by the spirit. Religious practices are there to refine the animal self and enable it to be guided by the light, soul or spirit. Most world religions advocate respect for life and all living things, and for humans to exercise modesty, generosity and accountability in upholding higher values, ethics, virtuous conduct, selfless service to other beings and constant gratitude to God irrespective of outer circumstances. All of this is meaningful and possible to follow if you accept the premise that our journey on earth is to rise in consciousness from the lowest animal selfish tendencies to pure consciousness, cosmic governance, or divine prevalence. Islam highlights what so many earlier prophets and sages before Muhammad had emphasised and tried to inculcate in their people and cultures. Unity The crucial issue is the unitive nature of truth and reality or God as the source of life and all creation, and this cosmic source is also the final destiny. Everything has emanated from that essence and returns to it. The teachings of the Qur\u2019an and the way of Muhammad also highlight the purpose of human existence and its transient nature from the lower self to the divine soul itself, from birth to death, all of which is in preparation for the full unveiling of Truth after death \u2013 eternal cosmic connectedness. Death is a most natural transfer from dualities and confinement within space and time to eternal oneness. The Qur\u2019an reveals that real life is ever continuous and not subject to beginnings or ends, such as birth and death. We experience, in fact, two modes of birth and death. One birth is physical, biological and emotional, and the other one is awakening to the ultimate truth, which is the nature of our own soul. This spiritual birth is the essential drive within all human desires and hopes, the source of which can be accessed and touched upon through transcendence of all sensory experiences and conditioned consciousness. A preparation for this is meditation, contemplation, silence and solitude. The Qur\u2019an and prophetic teachings emphasise the duty and purpose of human beings, which is to transcend the lower self to the divine soul in preparation for ongoingness in the hereafter. Real education and grooming evolves us to act as accountable and responsible earthly stewards \u2013 the master is the divine soul. All our life experiences are practices towards higher infinite consciousness, and the many grades, scales, zones and domains that it encompasses. All of this will be experienced fully after a period of the rattling and shaking of purification after death, described by most world religions. The Abrahamic religions are clear about heaven, hell and purgatory. Others have similar teachings, including that of reincarnation \u2013 if you haven\u2019t succeeded in transcending to higher consciousness then you will return. All world religions have some notion that if you have not progressed sufficiently towards higher consciousness before death then there is going to be a \u2019decompression\u2019 so that whatever you have carried within yourself as traces and fantasies is eradicated. But if you have practiced eradication, like the Buddhist practice of death with its eight different stages, then it is a natural progression towards liberation from the illusion of separation. Practicing Surrender Islam, like some other world religions, prescribes practices that elevate consciousness through reflecting upon day-to-day habits, which are otherwise performed without full attention or reflection. The human purpose on earth is to ascend in consciousness from a very basic survival level to illumined awakening and arrival. When self-awareness becomes a natural constant habit, then every moment becomes enriched with vibrancy and delight. Religious practices and rituals are the beginnings of alignment between self and soul and transcending the material world to higher consciousness. Formally, you pray five times a day (which also has an important social aspect to it) until, as the Qur\u2019an describes, you are perpetually in that plugged-in state. The same applies to all other rituals. In a sense, you are at all times on pilgrimage. While with fasting, you are at all times aware of what you are putting in your mouth or what you are putting in your head. So let this month be different from other months, even if you cannot fast. Whatever you ingest, be aware of it, be more conscious of it. Marvel at how it is possible for you to lift your hand or even a finger. Enter the magic of this month so that all year round you will be aware of where you are sitting, why you are drinking, where you put your cup. Your whole life then becomes an act of worship. Life has to flow. It has to be fun and we all seek and hope for that. Initially with a child there is a little bribery and corruption \u2013 \u2018Do it for mummy\u2019s sake\u2019. But later on, by being in the dot of the now, by being present, you are already participating in the treasures of eternal life. If you are truly practicing silence and awareness of the moment and its immensity, then you know time and non-time; the eternal and the short, all lie in that moment. So you will know that the present moment, of which you are experiencing a little of its coming and its going, is perfect. You will know that the present moment contains within it eternity. You will know it is perfect. Bring that to the social level and you will never ever lament the difficulties of today \u2013 the bad culture, people don\u2019t listen, children are rebellious, etc. You must not regurgitate what you have been reiterating from the past. Read it. It will tell you. There is utter perfection in the moment; therefore, if you take today\u2019s time, you will recognise it is much better than ten years ago and much much better than a hundred years ago. This is a touchstone of contentment. The present moment contains all that happened in the past and gives a clear indication of what will happen in the future. By denying the perfection of the moment we will lack contentment and happiness will remain elusive. Divisions and differences between human beings are natural. So is our love for harmony and unity. Every one of us experiences constant change within space and time whilst we seek perspective and refer to higher consciousness with its boundless constancy. No two moments are the same for any living entity. Within each moment is the duality of what is attractive and what is not. Each and every living entity can act like a war machine with animosity and discord whilst wishing for peace and goodness, albeit in the distant future. How can we overcome enmity and discord, and accept differences in opinion, culture, or way of life, as natural occurrences just like the countless plants, flowers, flavors and colors? All humans are similar in many ways but also differ in other ways. No matter what we do, no matter what we say, every person and every people have a flavour. Reference to higher consciousness will put things in perspective and will show you the appropriate path. Lasting Contentment Peace and prosperity can only become durable when inner peace and contentment is attained when the self becomes subservient to the soul, thereby accessing timeless joy. Peace and prosperity become socially durable and universal when personal inner peace and contentment is attained by a number of people who have an influence over the community and society, and their guidance becomes a touchstone for normal conduct and behaviour. In the past, religious people, saints, sages and others were regarded as the ultimate reference points and arbiters when there were serious differences and disputes between people and communities. In our day-to-day life today we need the wisdom of perspective, durable goodness and true accountability regarding intentions and actions. The supreme treasure of all is the divine spirit within the heart, which is the ultimate guiding reference for fulfilled living. When a mature person is in constant attention, reflection and reference to the higher level of consciousness, then fulfillment is attained in the world of duality, change and uncertainty. This awakened being is constantly energised by permanent life and therefore regards death as a natural ascent to the liberated zone of eternal presence. Fears and sorrows become insignificant and the nature of death reveals itself to be a gift of liberation from the limitations of the earthly journey. Our limited world of dualities drives us to understand the cause and effect, origin and destiny, of all that exists in preparation for the state beyond death, beyond self-identity and the illusion of independence or separation from sacred oneness. Most of what we experience in nature is complementary and symbiotic and even where there appears to be divergence, nature acts to regulate the natural flow of diversities in life. With the human urge to investigate, study and discover the nature of material objects as well as feelings and emotions, we reach the conclusion that the entire of existence is differentiated sameness. No two moments are the same but the nature of time and space remains the same. If you simply live totally in the now then you are directly energised by higher eternal consciousness. Now is forever and so is the inner soul or spirit. So hasten with patience. Wait, especially if you are in a rush. Celebrate! It is human nature to be hopeful, cheerful and to celebrate goodness. Most people use any excuse to celebrate and leave behind sorrow, fear, or insecurity. We all love to celebrate \u2013 it is deep in the human psyche. Individually we celebrate within ourselves because that is our kingdom, and collectively with the wider kingdom. Celebration is victory, and victory is beyond success and failure. But we end up having pseudo-celebrations, like birthdays or the \u2018independence\u2019 of a country. We need to ask ourselves what is it that is worthy of celebration at all times and all occasions without any bitterness or regrets later on? Celebration is only going to be meaningful through Islam, Iman and Ihsan. Each is a zone of consciousness. Islam is that there is nothing in my hand; I didn\u2019t know who I was, I didn\u2019t know what was birth, I don\u2019t know what death is, so I have to surrender into the vast unknown. Iman is that I trust that it has been going on for millions of years so there must be some stability, some referencing, some governorship. That is Iman; I have faith, I have trust, I can rely upon the perfection that emerges from the unseen, whether experienced or not. Ihsan is that there is no \u2018me\u2019 anymore \u2013 there is only perfection; so if I am truly basking in that perfection I cannot but transmit that with which I have been saturated. Life is glorious and we celebrate it perpetually.","title":"Pointers to Haqq"},{"location":"articles/pointers-to-haqq/#pointers-to-haqq-truth","text":"Written by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri June 2018 Human needs, desires and questions never end.

Like other seekers before and after him, he went to solitary places for his periods of reflection. For the true seeker, this is not escapism, but a direct, positive attempt to find out where he comes from by reflecting upon what is closest to him, that is, his own self. Finally, he may reach a point of neutrality in which hardly any more of that self is left and it has been recognized in all its aspects by the seeker. He will have seen every angle of the so-called personality. The Black Stone of the Ka\u2018bah When this has been seen, the seeker moves on single-pointedly to blacking out, symbolized by the Black Stone of the Ka\u2018bah. It's important to understand this symbol more deeply. We live in duality, and we seek to neutralize, but how do we neutralize? We neutralize our nafs by remaining silent , genuinely and positively. In that silence we have direct knowledge of the meaning of the Black Stone which is set into the corner of the Ka\u2018bah in Mecca. Few Muslims know the meaning of the Black Stone, even though they perform the rite of circling it and kissing it during the \u1e24ajj (pilgrimage) every year. Black contains all the colors \u2014 it symbolizes death, from which comes life. Life cannot be understood unless one is willing to die. Thus the Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , moves toward a state of no attributes, reaching, as the Sufis say, close to the suns of essence, moving away from the stars of attributes. First, he quietens his actions. Next, he moves into a subtler realm of attributes, and from there he crosses the boundary of essence. From that point on, one is traversing another realm. This process is not directly discernable or describable; another set of rules begins to apply. It is a no-man\u2019s land where no one can help anybody else, except by discussing its outer boundaries. It is an experiential state that everyone interprets differently. It is like an event which causes a great shock and which everybody tries to describe in a different language. It is a taste, a higher taste; it is a great opening. It is the explosive germination of the heart. Die Before You Die This opening is, of course, devastating as we see from what happened to Sayyidna Musa, \u2018alayhi-s-sal\u0101m . It is a shattering experience; it is not simply another experience of life, but rather of another realm. We can only go so far in understanding knowledge and information regarding our realm of consciousness which is in fact an aspect of a higher consciousness. It is like the story of a person who lives under water. He has a good consciousness of what is under water and he understands what goes on there. He may also have had quite a lot of glimpses of what is above water. But it is a different experience to actually be above water. No matter how much he may be prepared for it, it still is a shock, and when this occurred to the Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , he was in such a state of shock that some people even said he had gone mad. As a method for dealing with the views of others, the Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , often emphasized the importance of remembrance of death and being prepared for it at all times. \u2018Die before you die\u2019 is a frequently quoted tradition. The general meaning of the teaching is to be ready to leave this world in submission to the will of the generous and just God with ease and peace of mind. This state is attained by having the least amount of attachments to, and love of, worldly belongings and relationships. A deeper meaning is to let the lower consciousness die (\u2018lower life\u2019 is often quoted in the Qur\u2019an) and to live for and by the higher (\u2018other\u2019, \u2018later\u2019 or \u2018lasting\u2019 life), which relates to God consciousness. These teachings and Qur\u2019anic verses become transformative when one reflects and meditates upon the purpose and meaning of life and the human freedom and responsibility. Islam is the path of grooming the lower self and purifying the heart and unifying the self and soul. This spiritual evolvement will lift the individual consciousness out of the ever-changing worldly uncertainties to the domain of insights and inner delights. Whatever we love in this world we shall lose, except the sacred soul which lives on. When we remember that the end may come at any minute and we remember that we are suspended in air (one word related to nafs is nafas , meaning breath), we become more human. The Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , said, \u201cPeople are asleep, and when they die they wake up.\u201d True seekers want to die while being awake \u2014 they want to enter a state of total silence. All the practices of the men of Allah from time immemorial lead man, the seeker, to inner death while still alive. If, while we are conscious, aware, and scintillating with life, we can enter a state of self-abandonment, then we will understand what inner death is. If we cannot reach this state, then we will remain in the turmoil of sa\u2018y, that is, running between \u1e62af\u0101 and Marwah in Mecca.","title":"The Shock of Awakening"},{"location":"articles/shock-awakening/#the-shock-of-awakening","text":"By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri from the book \u201cBeams of Illumination from the Divine Revelation \u2013 A Commentary on the Last Section of the Qur\u2019an\u201d By the time the first five ayat of Surat-ul-\u2018Alaq were revealed to him, the Prophet, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa sallam , had already been regularly spending days, weeks, and months in meditation in a cave in order to penetrate the layers of his nafs , thereby following the path of all those before him who followed the dictum: \u201cHe who knows himself knows his Lord.\u201d The path towards the knowledge of lordship, of sustainership, is by way of the recognition of what is closest to us, which is all the different selves, or aspects of ourselves.

For the true seeker, this is not escapism, but a direct, positive attempt to find out where he comes from by reflecting upon what is closest to him, that is, his own self.

What is relevant to us today about Sufism is that it has maintained a clear thread and line of direct transmission of wisdom back to original Islam. The key to Sufism is that of inner awakening, freedom and joy through recognition of outer restriction by choice and discrimination. \u2026 The reason that the majority of current studies on Sufism are of little use in a practical sense is because of the nature of inner awakening itself, which is the core of Sufism. Writing books about inner awakening is only really possible if one has experienced it, just as understanding of such books is only really possible if one genuinely desires, or has already attained, such awakening. The Sufi is the locus of connecting the outer, physical reality with a timeless, spaceless dimension which is experienced within the self. The Sufi lives like the tip of the iceberg which is apparent in the seen world, while experiencing aspects of the hidden and veiled world which is the foundation of what is visible, and which forms the rest of its reality. He does his best to understand the causal, physical outer life while awakening to an immense inner Reality, which encompasses both the known and the unknown worlds, the unitive Reality of the seen and the unseen, of time and space and non-time-space. It is for this reason that the inner life of the Sufi has no bounds, and yet he acknowledges and accepts the outer bounds with courtesy towards nature and the natural creation. The Sufi is totally content with the immeasurable bliss within. Yet he struggles outwardly towards a better quality of life on earth and does his best without being overly concerned about the ultimate results. Outer struggle and work are necessary companions to inner purification and contentment. Genuine Sufis are essentially similar wherever they come from, in that they share an inner light and awakening, and an outer courtesy and service to humanity. Apparent differences between Sufis tend to relate to matters concerning spiritual practices or prescriptions for the purification of hearts. The sweet fruit of Sufism is the same. It is only the trees which may look different and which may flower in different seasons. In this work, we have tried to show that those who claim that it is possible to have Sufism without Islam are only looking at one side of the story. Inner purity is generally attainable, but without its being contained outwardly, it will not result in any real flourishing of a spiritual culture or an enlightened environment. Inner light and joy may be sufficient for an individual living in a cave, but once we start interacting with others, we need to know where and what the bounds are for that social interaction to be able to take place, and this is where we find that the laws of Islam are necessary and inseparable from Sufism. Emptying Out, Sweetening, Purifying The first step for a seeker to take is to witness, pure and simple. It is to be watchful, to be aware, to allow that which is higher in you to enable you to witness what goes on within you. In the state of watchfulness, at the beginning, there is usually a storm of thoughts. With guidance and perseverance, these bubbles of thoughts surface and vanish. This is the stage of emptying out. It is the cleaning of the mind-processor so that no psychological or emotional memories remain to contaminate the mind-computer. Then begins the process of sweetening. In order to achieve the ability to connect with the inner central core of one\u2019s self at any time and in any place, one needs to be sweetened. It is a process of displacement. It is like a bucket of muddy water which becomes purified by placing it under a running tap of sweet, clean water, until all the mud in the water has been displaced and the water in the bucket purified. The speed at which the tap flows depends on the size and capacity of the bucket. This is where a teacher is required for help. If the seeker is ready, the teacher simply pushes him into the ocean of awakening, which is what happened with Shaykh Abu\u2019l Hasan ash-Shadhili. When he reached his teacher, after having already mastered all the outer knowledges of Islam, he was simply asked to renew his ritual purification through washing. His spiritual master, Shaykh Abd as-Salam ibn Mashish, told him to descend the mountain and renew his ritual purification through washing and then to return, When Shaykh ash-Shadhili returned, it only took one look from his spiritual master for him to understand the meaning of all that had gone on before and after and the purpose of the meeting between the two of them. The seeker recognized the teacher and the teacher recognized the seeker instantaneously. However, there are those seekers who need continuous sweetening, encouragement and guidance before inward purification can occur. So sweetening is a process which is followed by purification. In actual life these three processes \u2013 emptying out, sweetening and purification \u2013 are carried out and take place simultaneously. They are three dimensions of the same process as they reinforce each other, leading toward the desired end result. They all go hand in hand. Surrendering Attachment Nothing is wrong with the world. There is nothing wrong with the creation. Everything is in a perfect form in its perfect place at the perfect time. It is my attitude towards it which causes me pain. The postman arrives and there is a letter for me informing me that a house in the countryside, which I love, has burned down and the roof has caved in. Those wonderful antique paintings are completely ruined. I am ruined! The Sufi says: \"You have to surrender. There is nothing wrong with the house provided that when it collapses, you do not collapse with it. It is the surrendering of the ownership/attachment aspect of it. The fact is, you can only carry out an activity efficiently if you are not attached to it. You can only run a business efficiently if you are not attached to it.\" The seeds of all emotional attributes are in us inwardly, otherwise we could not comprehend them when we see them outwardly. The seed of fear is in us, thus we all know what fear is. We all understand what pain is. We all understand what anger is. We understand all these things because we are all from the same source. We are all creatures of God, we have come from God and to God we return. We have all been created in the same manner with the same consciousness. We are all sons and daughters of Adam. And, therefore, from that point of view, \u2018I\u2019 the individual, the microcosm, reflect and contain the characteristics of the macrocosm. This is my little world and that is the entire world. But in my little world are to be found the miniatures of the outside world, and, therefore, the secrets of the outside world. We say we are looking for self-fulfilment. So there is nothing other than your own self-fulfilment. And that can only come when your mind is quiet. Conclusion The relevance of Sufism today is greater than it has been in any other age, for nowadays we can cross cultural and political boundaries much more easily, because of ease of access through communications, travel and closeness of the world. The message of Sufism is more urgent now, especially due to the fact that the world is increasingly becoming bound by materialism and consumerism. The awakening to the inner life of man is a necessary condition of his fulfillment as a human being. It comes as the pinnacle of his struggle with the elements and the fulfillment of his basic needs. Once our outer needs are met, then the inner must also be fulfilled. The two are so interlinked that those who are awakened to both the outer and inner realities see them as inseparable and continuous in the one creational, unific truth. The heart of an awakened being reflects the entire universe and such a being is described by the Sufi master, Ibn Arabi, in these words: My heart has become capable of every form: It is a pasture for gazelles, And a monastery for Christian monks, And a temple for idols, And the pilgrim\u2019s Ka\u2019bah, And the tablets of the Torah, And the Book of the Qur\u2018an. I follow the religion of Love: Whatever way Love\u2019s camel takes, That is my religion and my faith.","title":"Sufism and the Sufi"},{"location":"articles/sufism-sufi/#sufism-and-the-sufi","text":"By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri, from the book \"The Thoughtful Guide to Sufism\" .

The internet and other media makes this easily accessible to all, rather than being the preserve of the few. This has had a huge impact on understanding of Sufi tariqas, masters and their teachings. The clear discipline and teachings of the great Sufi masters, such as Ibn \u2018Ata\u2019 Allah al- Iskandari, Abdullah Ansari, Ibn al-\u2018Arabi and Mulla Sadra, can help any serious spiritual seeker. Original Islam can now be practiced and lived by most people without fear of retribution from unjust and rigid authorities, who impose uniformity of thought in their fear of losing control over people\u2019s minds and hearts. The rise of social networking and the internet has made access to this rich heritage easy, though one has to sift through the sites judiciously for authentic and transformative teachings. During the past few decades research projects on the lives and teachings of numerous Sufi Shaykhs and spiritual masters have become popular. These studies have come out of European or American universities with a few from the east. Metaphysical poetry and spiritual songs have also been rediscovered and made public by literary and spiritually-oriented individuals and organizations. It is not an accident that Rumi has for many years been so frequently quoted and read in the West and is one of the best-selling poets in the States, probably in large part due to the interpretive translations of Coleman Barks and others. These are all signs that our scientific and material development is reaching a point that needs the revitalization of the heart and awakening to the inner light of the soul. Normal human consciousness is beginning to be regarded as one of many strands of accessible consciousness, starting from the local and conditioned state to full and boundless light of the cosmic consciousness \u2013 Allah. The golden thread amongst all of these works is the constant reference to an Essence or Reality that transcends all that is discerned by human senses and the mind. The idea of God being the preserve of a specific religion or people is being superseded by the durable idea of universal Oneness or supreme consciousness. Muslims, especially the Sufis, have constantly referred to the return to the truth that there is only one unique Essence (Allah, God) in creation and that everything else is simply an overflow of grace and manifestation of that primal light. Whatever there is in existence has a trace of its origin in it. Whatever is born will also die. This encourages the mind to reflect on what is eternally present and constant whilst also experiencing change and the dualities in creation. Whenever I asked an enlightened teacher what my duties in life ought to be, I received the same answer: as long as your focus is upon reducing your personal concern or \u2018separate identity\u2019, you are on the right track of liberating yourself from your \u2018lower\u2019 self. The Prophet Musa was ordered to take off his sandals (symbolizing protection and separation) before the Burning Bush. When personal identity or the illusion of independence is lost to a higher consciousness, then every moment and every place is sacred. For those, who have the will and interest to transcend the limitations of body and mind, the opportunities exist today, as they have always done. Sacredness is what holds the universe and consciousness of life. Humans are driven to realize the highest level of consciousness. Sufism is a natural human expression of the quest for knowledge of what connects and unifies the universe in all its diversity; the links of the seen and the unseen \u2013 the thread of Truth. Understanding Unity (Tawhid) Allah says: \"You are certainly on a clear path, a straight and direct way\" Qur'an, 36:04 The \u2018straight path\u2019 ( al-sirat al-mustaqim ) is the shortest distance between two points, between subject and object, between man and Allah. That is why it is direct, for it stretches from man to what he is always seeking, which is the All-Encompassing Reality. The understanding of unity (tawhid) is the straight path (al-sirat al-mustaqim), but it cannot be the subject of mere intellectual study. One must move along the path of submission (islam), through belief (iman) to sublime excellence (ihsan), until one begins to have glimpses of unity, through which one can then dive into the world of meaning. If the goal of unity ( tawhid ) is not constantly present in the minds of the Muslims, their Islam becomes diluted and falls by the wayside. Mosques become either totally empty or only superficially full, because most of the people there are attending only as a matter of form. In many parts of the Muslim world this is what one finds, because the path is no longer about remembrance of Allah ( dhikru\u2019llah ), nor about wanting knowledge of Allah. In many places Islam itself has been put on a pedestal and is being worshipped instead of Allah. Islam, however, is a means to the knowledge of Allah, not the object itself. We all love what is timeless. We all love what is absolute. Does anyone not want to live forever, past this life and on into the next? This means that we all love the One Who is forever living. The love of Allah, therefore, is already in our hearts, but we become diverted, we rationalize: \u2018Not now, tomorrow or next year, when I finish with this or that business.\u2019 We blame other people for our lack of time and all our other problems as well. The truth is that we only have ourselves to blame.","title":"The Thread of Truth"},{"location":"articles/thread-of-truth/#the-thread-of-truth","text":"By Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri and Muneera Haeri, from the book \"Sufi Links \u2013 Illumined Encounters\" A vast body of academic work including chronicles, biographies, treaties, translations on Islam and Sufism has arisen out of the interest in religion and spirituality over the recent past. The internet and other media makes this easily accessible to all, rather than being the preserve of the few. This has had a huge impact on understanding of Sufi tariqas, masters and their teachings. The clear discipline and teachings of the great Sufi masters, such as Ibn \u2018Ata\u2019 Allah al- Iskandari, Abdullah Ansari, Ibn al-\u2018Arabi and Mulla Sadra, can help any serious spiritual seeker. Original Islam can now be practiced and lived by most people without fear of retribution from unjust and rigid authorities, who impose uniformity of thought in their fear of losing control over people\u2019s minds and hearts. The rise of social networking and the internet has made access to this rich heritage easy, though one has to sift through the sites judiciously for authentic and transformative teachings. During the past few decades research projects on the lives and teachings of numerous Sufi Shaykhs and spiritual masters have become popular. These studies have come out of European or American universities with a few from the east. Metaphysical poetry and spiritual songs have also been rediscovered and made public by literary and spiritually-oriented individuals and organizations. It is not an accident that Rumi has for many years been so frequently quoted and read in the West and is one of the best-selling poets in the States, probably in large part due to the interpretive translations of Coleman Barks and others. These are all signs that our scientific and material development is reaching a point that needs the revitalization of the heart and awakening to the inner light of the soul. Normal human consciousness is beginning to be regarded as one of many strands of accessible consciousness, starting from the local and conditioned state to full and boundless light of the cosmic consciousness \u2013 Allah. The golden thread amongst all of these works is the constant reference to an Essence or Reality that transcends all that is discerned by human senses and the mind. The idea of God being the preserve of a specific religion or people is being superseded by the durable idea of universal Oneness or supreme consciousness. Muslims, especially the Sufis, have constantly referred to the return to the truth that there is only one unique Essence (Allah, God) in creation and that everything else is simply an overflow of grace and manifestation of that primal light. Whatever there is in existence has a trace of its origin in it. Whatever is born will also die. This encourages the mind to reflect on what is eternally present and constant whilst also experiencing change and the dualities in creation. Whenever I asked an enlightened teacher what my duties in life ought to be, I received the same answer: as long as your focus is upon reducing your personal concern or \u2018separate identity\u2019, you are on the right track of liberating yourself from your \u2018lower\u2019 self. The Prophet Musa was ordered to take off his sandals (symbolizing protection and separation) before the Burning Bush. When personal identity or the illusion of independence is lost to a higher consciousness, then every moment and every place is sacred. For those, who have the will and interest to transcend the limitations of body and mind, the opportunities exist today, as they have always done. Sacredness is what holds the universe and consciousness of life. Humans are driven to realize the highest level of consciousness. Sufism is a natural human expression of the quest for knowledge of what connects and unifies the universe in all its diversity; the links of the seen and the unseen \u2013 the thread of Truth.","title":"The Thread of Truth"},{"location":"articles/thread-of-truth/#understanding-unity-tawhid","text":"Allah says: \"You are certainly on a clear path, a straight and direct way\" Qur'an, 36:04 The \u2018straight path\u2019 ( al-sirat al-mustaqim ) is the shortest distance between two points, between subject and object, between man and Allah. That is why it is direct, for it stretches from man to what he is always seeking, which is the All-Encompassing Reality. The understanding of unity (tawhid) is the straight path (al-sirat al-mustaqim), but it cannot be the subject of mere intellectual study. One must move along the path of submission (islam), through belief (iman) to sublime excellence (ihsan), until one begins to have glimpses of unity, through which one can then dive into the world of meaning. If the goal of unity ( tawhid ) is not constantly present in the minds of the Muslims, their Islam becomes diluted and falls by the wayside. Mosques become either totally empty or only superficially full, because most of the people there are attending only as a matter of form. In many parts of the Muslim world this is what one finds, because the path is no longer about remembrance of Allah ( dhikru\u2019llah ), nor about wanting knowledge of Allah. In many places Islam itself has been put on a pedestal and is being worshipped instead of Allah. Islam, however, is a means to the knowledge of Allah, not the object itself. We all love what is timeless. We all love what is absolute. Does anyone not want to live forever, past this life and on into the next? This means that we all love the One Who is forever living. The love of Allah, therefore, is already in our hearts, but we become diverted, we rationalize: \u2018Not now, tomorrow or next year, when I finish with this or that business.\u2019 We blame other people for our lack of time and all our other problems as well. The truth is that we only have ourselves to blame.","title":"Understanding Unity (Tawhid)"},{"location":"articles/to-be-alive/","text":"To Be Alive Like everything else in life, whatever it may be, a thing, an entity, a particle, an idea or an energy, it comes in twos, and these twos can double up again and again. In a similar way, there are two versions of being alive. Conditioned Consciousness The first version is the simple awareness of being a living, breathing human being; this is sentiency. We say, \u201cI am alive because I am conscious and through that consciousness I can manipulate my hand or my movement\u201d. This is the definition and experience of conditioned consciousness. It is the idea of having your own life and asking, \u201cWhat are you doing with your life?\u201d It\u2019s the idea that \u201clife is precious\u201d \u201ctime is precious\u201d \u201ceverything will pass\u201d \u201cyou only have one life to live\u201d. This places us in a box where we remain anchored to our perception of what \u201cour life\u201d is. It is this box that causes the fear, anxiety and concern when reflecting on the inevitable cycle of birth and death. Combined Consciousness The second version of being alive is when limited, conditioned life, is combined with Life itself. This is truly being alive. To understand this better we first need to again consider the experience of limited consciousness and limited life. Rabbit consciousness, chimpanzee consciousness and intelligent philosopher consciousness are all limited, conditioned \u2018consciousness\u2019s\u2019. Each is different in its own way, and each is constantly changing through every moment. In the same way, each person experiences their own life and consciousness as constantly changing. Within this field of constant change we also experience everything as good or bad. Yet, we may have fooled ourselves into thinking that anything can really ever be good or bad. Lets take bright light as an example. Bright light may be too hot and too bright and therefore be judged, in a particular moment, as bad. But it is not the light that is bad; it is the perception of the light that is bad. The light itself is beyond judgements of good or bad, it is simply light. If the perception of light does not lead to the discovery of infinite light then I am not alive. And if I am not alive, then all the moments where I had joy are inconsequential because they have not lead me to the ultimate mine of joys that I can plug into. Only experience of the infinite light, beyond individual perception and judgement, will ever be good enough. In perceiving light, I have been given a small jewel that was brought from the mine of infinite light, and if I have no access to the mine, it is not good enough. What we all really seek is that which is permanently continuous and permanently connected. We do not want anything that may abruptly end. With any apparent disconnection, with any break from the infinite light we feel sad, we feel depressed. So human purpose, above the purpose of daily tasks and ambitions, is only to connect your life with Life itself. Connect your life with the Life from which your life is drawing its energy. If that is done, all is done. If that is not done, nothing is ever enough. Otherness and Oneness From mysterious Oneness, a plethora of every type of energy, matter and other realities emerged as every imaginable energy, material form, cycles or patterns in dualities, that balance each other. Pluralities emanate from the One and return to the One. Dualities appear as opposites or complimentary. They are twins. The two quarreling traders appear opposite to each other. Whereas in fact they are competing for what seems to them of limited availability. Dualities confirm unity. Disagreements and differences are due to perceiving otherness. He is not one of us; not the same religion, not the same nation. Even when obsessed by the desire to perceive through Oneness. Eyesight, memory and habit mask this Truth. The genesis of the veil of otherness is conditioned consciousness of human beings for survival. You notice mostly that which is different and ignore the familiar. The herder noticed somebody else with his goats and felt threatened. Animal survival needs. Otherness enforces the animal self for survival, protection and earthly ongoingness. Once you have actually experienced forever-ness of your own Soul then there would be a considerable erosion of the feeling of otherness. The awakened person sees sameness of essence and outer differences. The enlightened person only sees through the lens of Oneness. Reflective people become more aware of the light of the Soul. Life is work in progress. Otherness is a reminder of Oneness. Otherness is an outer encrustation or shell that has within it, the light of Oneness. The root of everything is Oneness. The present moment is only there because of Perpetual Oneness. Now slides through newness creating in its wake the experience of moving time. Now tomorrow is another time but yet is the same now. An illusion within space and time that seems to have changed. It has changed within the box of conditioned consciousness. But consciousness itself never changes. Truth is ever constant, only shadows emanating from it appear to change. Every entity indicates its sacred origin, often in subtle or veiled ways! Summing Up (to One) The formula for this process of accessing the infinite light is to do only with limited consciousness. It is the removal of all obstacles, and thereafter, higher consciousness remains. It is the process of saying \u201cno, no, no\u201d to everything else, but the infinite light. Then there is connection and continuity in perpetuity, outside of the limited box of personal consciousness. My personal cycle of birth and death is the magical connector between the infinite and finite, between metaphysics and physics. We are \u2018middle people\u2019, caught in the middle.

Remember, you can listen on these platforms: Anchor Apple Spotify Google Breaker Overcast Pocket Casts RadioPublic Islam and Tawhid This talk reflects upon a core aspect of the Islamic unveilings and path. Shaykh Fadhlalla seeks to elaborate and emphasize a living experience of the varying dimensions and modes for the traveler on the path of Oneness. Tawhid is the unequivocal statement of the oneness of reality. The Shaykh explores the Qur\u2019anic declaration of a total, single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible reality, entirely independent of creation, out of which complexity and multiplicity emanate and return. The Qur\u2019anic cosmology is introduced as a model of understanding the unitive nature of reality at its various levels, or the various levels of Tawhid . In this talk, Shaykh Fadhlallah examines each of these: Tawhid Af\u2019al - the unity of actions Tawhid al Sifat - the unity of attributes Tawhid ad Dhat - the unity of essence. The Shaykh presents the appropriate way in which one should relate to and understand this model and, critically, how to integrate it into a living process. He continues with an elaboration on key elements around this integral work. He also discusses the necessity of various virtues for the traveler on the path: honesty; authenticity in reflection; the meaning of worship; the reality of Salat and the fulfillment of its inner dynamics; sincerity; and the practice of remembrance, or dhikr . The entire talk is well summarised in the following key excerpt: \u201cYou can do it quietly, you don\u2019t have to tell people, you don\u2019t have to show off. Nothing changes! Be as you are, just do the salaat ! And then dhikr : remember it is l\u0101 \u02beil\u0101ha \u02beill\u0101 ll\u0101h . No need to change and say, \u2018I am now a different person!\u2019 You are not. You are the same idiot you have been all along, it\u2019s just that your channel to Allah is clearly open, and you recognize that higher Reality. Prostrate yourself and you will come to see that there is nowhere where Allah is not.\u201d Islam and Tawhid Listen Enlightenment This talk is a recording from an intimate setting hosted at Enlightenext centre in London. Shaykh Fadhlallah presents a personal account of his experience and understanding of the Sufi Path, reflecting on several fundamental questions and paradoxes surrounding human life. He begins by examining whether there is an optimum way to live, utilizing this question to present a map of creation which can be used to live a life of fulfilment, equanimity and ease. The Shaykh uses this description as a point of departure to connect his application of this map with the evolutionary process in which any traveler must undergo. We all want to rise in consciousness and this presents various challenges in both the social and experiential dynamics of living the fullness of human reality. Shaykh Fadhlalla draws from the Abrahamic, Sufi, and Muhammad traditions in presenting the various levels and arenas in which the traveler might discover and arrive in their navigation of the path. The emphasis is placed on the need for a lived experience of truth. Moreover, it is not only about walking along the road, but arriving at \u2018The City\u2019. This and several other key metaphors are regularly referenced as indications to the nature of the path and warnings of the multitudes of pitfalls the seeker encounters. The nature of harmony and balance; the interplay between the relative and the absolute; the Sufi sketch of higher and lower self and the nature of the authentic self; all this and more is presented in this talk. Shaykh Fadhlalla summarises the talk perfectly in this excerpt: \"If you are to give a talk on this issue of Oneness, I think you can sum it up by repeating \u201cone, two; one, two; One!\u201d From the One comes the two, and two seek to reproduce one; and that one is looking for its origin in duality, only to realize that the entire thing emanated from \u2018The One\u2019. l\u0101 \u02beil\u0101ha \u02beill\u0101 ll\u0101h: there is none other than One.\u2019 \u2018Without denying relative existence, you must come to understand your authentic self through honesty, good conduct, trust, love, and faith. \u2018Authenticity\u2019 can variously be imagined as the Soul, the higher self, or God\u2019s light within you. Once you grasp that such a sacred reference point exists within you, then talk of a map is no longer necessary. In fact, the map is no longer necessary, because it becomes just another kind of false security. The key question remains, 'Are you in The City?' And then, 'Have you discovered that there is actually neither you nor City?' The entire Light, which is beyond both known and unknown, is in you already. That is truly awesome. That is why one has to move with good conduct, with authenticity and genuine honesty, according to who you are. Here is the basis of arrival.\" Further talks on this topic can be found in another audio series entirely devoted to it. Enlightenment Listen Human Consciousness This talk is taken from an informal gathering hosted under the umbrella of The Academy of Self Knowledge . Shaykh Fadhlallah provides a brushstroke overview of the major topics to be covered in an extended retreat in Britain. The talk begins by reflecting on several contemporary issues, such as the modern world; the economic system and its social reality; humans in the history of both the evolution of life on earth and the cosmos; and the nature of consciousness. Shaykh Fadhlalla then narrows in on several key derivative issues The first takes the form of some foundational questions: Who are we? What is sentiency? What is the human journey? What is the 'spectrum of consciousness\u2019? How can we understand decree and destiny? The Shaykh then unpacks the Academy of Self Knowledge basic presentation of human cosmology, titled \"Self \u2013 Soul\" and disucsses the arrow of time and evolution of consciousness. From this, he moves into an examination of human heritage through cultures, history, religion and the underlying drive at the core of our experience and behaviour. Finally, he considers the developmental stages of consciousness as is emergent in the human being from infancy to full consciousness, outlined in five phases. The whole talk is interspersed with various Islamic and Qur\u2019anic references and concludes with a short Q A at its closure. Human Consciousness Listen Muslim Awakening In this intimate and reflective discourse, Shaykh Fadhlallah engages several of the cores issues relevant to living the spiritual path. He elaborates on the basic nature of the mind in human cosmology as an interspace between the seen and unseen, exploring the necessity and foundation of practicing reason and rationality whilst exploring the key driving force in human life. That is to go beyond the boundaries of mental movements and projections into stillness. The basis of moving into the transcendent is explored. The Skaykh then examines the heart as the spiritual center of the human being, and the means of purifying the heart so that we may rise to the higher. Shaykh Fadhlalla then examines the life forces programmed within us that aid the surge in consciousness towards the boundless origin, with the introduction of the unified cosmology of the Muhammadan map of existence. Several key representations of life\u2019s paradoxes are engaged: the critical dichotomy between otherness and oneness; the basis of generosity; the levels of meaning; and cause and effect - all accompanied by a distilled presentation of the various outstanding contributors to the science of the self. The essential indications relevant to grooming of the lower self are presented so as to assist you in working with the driving forces that make up the self and universal attributes. Grooming and containing the lower self is a means of attaining a balanced inner ecology that is the foundation of inner harmony and justice and the basis of liberation from the shadows of the past and concerns for the future. Once balanced, you may knock at the doorway of presence. Muslim Awakening Listen Die Before You Die The title of this talk is a translation of a famous tradition from the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), relating to the process of inner death. Shaykh Fadhlalla elaborates on several of life\u2019s fundamental questions - who are we?, what is death?, and how should we relate to it? - as a prelude to delving into the spiritual dimensions of this famous axiom of the prophetic, original Islamic path. Reflections on various contemporary recorded experiences of near death are presented as a further window into a fundamental understanding of reality. As always, the Shaykh contrasts the changing nature of limited transitory experience with the boundless, unseen, unknown. Shaykh Fadhlalla explores some key indications from amongst various Islamic and Sufi contributors all of whom elaborate on the internal mechanisms and meanings of death as a key to awakening to truth. An understanding of the complimentary nature in which the forces of life and death relate is offered, interspersed with reflections on Qur\u2019anic verses, terms, prescriptions and descriptions of the world, the next life, and the process of inner death as the purification of your heart's clutter. This decreases one's attachment to this transient life, allowing for the amplified resonance with the soul within. Various allusions to the classical cosmology of the self are made, and death is modelled as the transcendence of limited consciousness into the zone of higher consciousness. Die Before You Die Listen What Does It Mean To Be A Sufi In The 21 st Century? This is a recording of a webinar on 25 January 2020 with Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri (South Africa), Issa Baba (Turkey) and Shaykh Saadi (Neil Douglas-Klotz, Scotland). Organized by the Beyond Initiative of the Dances of Universal Peace. Interviewers: Arjun Calero (Columbia) and Aziz Dixon (England). What Does It Mean To Be A Sufi In The 21 st Century? Listen The Perpetual Now A tree is a good metaphor for indicating the dynamic manifestation of Reality in every moment. From the 'Root of Oneness', creation occurs as dispersion. This occurs over time as well as in every moment. Ordinarily, we don't experience the amazing inseparability in our consciousness of how Oneness becomes sunlight and water and how these become the flower and how the flower the beautiful fragrance. They are seamlessly connected. There are many different strands that we can follow to explain this Unitive Totality. The most universally understandable is through the description of the experience of the Now. In this audio recording Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri takes the listener on an incredible journey through an enlightened experience of the Now.

In this talk, Shaykh Fadhlallah examines each of these: Tawhid Af\u2019al - the unity of actions Tawhid al Sifat - the unity of attributes Tawhid ad Dhat - the unity of essence. The Shaykh presents the appropriate way in which one should relate to and understand this model and, critically, how to integrate it into a living process. He continues with an elaboration on key elements around this integral work. He also discusses the necessity of various virtues for the traveler on the path: honesty; authenticity in reflection; the meaning of worship; the reality of Salat and the fulfillment of its inner dynamics; sincerity; and the practice of remembrance, or dhikr . The entire talk is well summarised in the following key excerpt: \u201cYou can do it quietly, you don\u2019t have to tell people, you don\u2019t have to show off. Nothing changes! Be as you are, just do the salaat ! And then dhikr : remember it is l\u0101 \u02beil\u0101ha \u02beill\u0101 ll\u0101h . No need to change and say, \u2018I am now a different person!\u2019 You are not. You are the same idiot you have been all along, it\u2019s just that your channel to Allah is clearly open, and you recognize that higher Reality. Prostrate yourself and you will come to see that there is nowhere where Allah is not.\u201d Islam and Tawhid Listen","title":"Islam and Tawhid"},{"location":"audios/single-talks/#enlightenment","text":"This talk is a recording from an intimate setting hosted at Enlightenext centre in London. Shaykh Fadhlallah presents a personal account of his experience and understanding of the Sufi Path, reflecting on several fundamental questions and paradoxes surrounding human life. He begins by examining whether there is an optimum way to live, utilizing this question to present a map of creation which can be used to live a life of fulfilment, equanimity and ease. The Shaykh uses this description as a point of departure to connect his application of this map with the evolutionary process in which any traveler must undergo. We all want to rise in consciousness and this presents various challenges in both the social and experiential dynamics of living the fullness of human reality. Shaykh Fadhlalla draws from the Abrahamic, Sufi, and Muhammad traditions in presenting the various levels and arenas in which the traveler might discover and arrive in their navigation of the path. The emphasis is placed on the need for a lived experience of truth. Moreover, it is not only about walking along the road, but arriving at \u2018The City\u2019. This and several other key metaphors are regularly referenced as indications to the nature of the path and warnings of the multitudes of pitfalls the seeker encounters. The nature of harmony and balance; the interplay between the relative and the absolute; the Sufi sketch of higher and lower self and the nature of the authentic self; all this and more is presented in this talk. Shaykh Fadhlalla summarises the talk perfectly in this excerpt: \"If you are to give a talk on this issue of Oneness, I think you can sum it up by repeating \u201cone, two; one, two; One!\u201d From the One comes the two, and two seek to reproduce one; and that one is looking for its origin in duality, only to realize that the entire thing emanated from \u2018The One\u2019. l\u0101 \u02beil\u0101ha \u02beill\u0101 ll\u0101h: there is none other than One.\u2019 \u2018Without denying relative existence, you must come to understand your authentic self through honesty, good conduct, trust, love, and faith. \u2018Authenticity\u2019 can variously be imagined as the Soul, the higher self, or God\u2019s light within you. Once you grasp that such a sacred reference point exists within you, then talk of a map is no longer necessary. In fact, the map is no longer necessary, because it becomes just another kind of false security. The key question remains, 'Are you in The City?' And then, 'Have you discovered that there is actually neither you nor City?' The entire Light, which is beyond both known and unknown, is in you already. That is truly awesome. That is why one has to move with good conduct, with authenticity and genuine honesty, according to who you are. Here is the basis of arrival.\" Further talks on this topic can be found in another audio series entirely devoted to it.

Shaykh Fadhlallah provides a brushstroke overview of the major topics to be covered in an extended retreat in Britain. The talk begins by reflecting on several contemporary issues, such as the modern world; the economic system and its social reality; humans in the history of both the evolution of life on earth and the cosmos; and the nature of consciousness. Shaykh Fadhlalla then narrows in on several key derivative issues The first takes the form of some foundational questions: Who are we? What is sentiency? What is the human journey? What is the 'spectrum of consciousness\u2019? How can we understand decree and destiny? The Shaykh then unpacks the Academy of Self Knowledge basic presentation of human cosmology, titled \"Self \u2013 Soul\" and disucsses the arrow of time and evolution of consciousness. From this, he moves into an examination of human heritage through cultures, history, religion and the underlying drive at the core of our experience and behaviour. Finally, he considers the developmental stages of consciousness as is emergent in the human being from infancy to full consciousness, outlined in five phases. The whole talk is interspersed with various Islamic and Qur\u2019anic references and concludes with a short Q A at its closure. Human Consciousness Listen","title":"Human Consciousness"},{"location":"audios/single-talks/#muslim-awakening","text":"In this intimate and reflective discourse, Shaykh Fadhlallah engages several of the cores issues relevant to living the spiritual path. He elaborates on the basic nature of the mind in human cosmology as an interspace between the seen and unseen, exploring the necessity and foundation of practicing reason and rationality whilst exploring the key driving force in human life. That is to go beyond the boundaries of mental movements and projections into stillness. The basis of moving into the transcendent is explored. The Skaykh then examines the heart as the spiritual center of the human being, and the means of purifying the heart so that we may rise to the higher. Shaykh Fadhlalla then examines the life forces programmed within us that aid the surge in consciousness towards the boundless origin, with the introduction of the unified cosmology of the Muhammadan map of existence. Several key representations of life\u2019s paradoxes are engaged: the critical dichotomy between otherness and oneness; the basis of generosity; the levels of meaning; and cause and effect - all accompanied by a distilled presentation of the various outstanding contributors to the science of the self. The essential indications relevant to grooming of the lower self are presented so as to assist you in working with the driving forces that make up the self and universal attributes. Grooming and containing the lower self is a means of attaining a balanced inner ecology that is the foundation of inner harmony and justice and the basis of liberation from the shadows of the past and concerns for the future. Once balanced, you may knock at the doorway of presence. Muslim Awakening Listen","title":"Muslim Awakening"},{"location":"audios/single-talks/#die-before-you-die","text":"The title of this talk is a translation of a famous tradition from the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), relating to the process of inner death. Shaykh Fadhlalla elaborates on several of life\u2019s fundamental questions - who are we?, what is death?, and how should we relate to it? - as a prelude to delving into the spiritual dimensions of this famous axiom of the prophetic, original Islamic path. Reflections on various contemporary recorded experiences of near death are presented as a further window into a fundamental understanding of reality. As always, the Shaykh contrasts the changing nature of limited transitory experience with the boundless, unseen, unknown. Shaykh Fadhlalla explores some key indications from amongst various Islamic and Sufi contributors all of whom elaborate on the internal mechanisms and meanings of death as a key to awakening to truth. An understanding of the complimentary nature in which the forces of life and death relate is offered, interspersed with reflections on Qur\u2019anic verses, terms, prescriptions and descriptions of the world, the next life, and the process of inner death as the purification of your heart's clutter. This decreases one's attachment to this transient life, allowing for the amplified resonance with the soul within. Various allusions to the classical cosmology of the self are made, and death is modelled as the transcendence of limited consciousness into the zone of higher consciousness.

The phenomena of birth and death are one of several key pairs in the map of existence. This talk serves to reflect upon what is the appropriate response to these key modulations. The ground of the inquisition revolves around three questions: Who am I, who is God or the essence, what is death? Shaykh Fadhlalla presents both the interrelation and particularity of these three issues, broadening the field of inquiry into the meaning of death. Various references are made to contemporary areas of interest such as Near Death Experiences and the multifaceted implications for human consciousness these exposures may engender.

These two forces are critical complementary dynamics that frame the basket of human life. Shaykh Fadhlalla presents human interaction and experience of fear as a pivotal force in the evolutionary drive within human consciousness and indicates the context in which ancient cultures framed their vision of the world by virtue of the lens of this phenomena, hence the cultural and linguistic dynamics of those peoples reflect this relation. This is contrasted to the model of life encountered by modern man in which hope and good expectation are the primary forces that filter perception. An understanding of the parallels of this evolutionary dimension is critical in approaching revealed knowledges and ancient tradition in the drive to appropriately connect with the timeless meaning beneath the relative filter of these emergences. This episode presents the existential sketch of the categories of fear before introducing the Qur\u2019anic model expounding upon the degrees of fear in relation to Higher consciousness.

A complex and detailed exposition on both issues is presented, via the references of the Linguistic dynamics of various Qur\u2019anic terms, prophetic teachings and injunctions towards the true meaning of the good life by referring to the complementarity of these forces, reflecting upon the directives that are presented in referencing life\u2019s events within this intrinsic design.

The appropriate prescriptive steps and descriptive qualifications in, adequately navigating through the interplay of these dynamics are presented through Qur\u2019anic expressions. The faculty of the heart is presented as the central locus of experience in these processes.

Several brief descriptions are explored in presenting the multifaceted nature of the Qur\u2019anic unveilings. Shaykh Fadhlalla presents four primary themes in this fundamental disclosure of Qur\u2019anic lights: The centrality and core of Oneness The ineffability of the cosmic nature and essence. This is really a synthesis on the nature of duality and the varieties and combinations of dualities that emerge from source consciousness. Several aspects of the nature of complementarity and opposition which occur in dual cycles and pairs are further explored. Human nature and design, and the prescriptions and connections between the Qur\u2019anic models of life, reality, and the prophetic way of living. Various injunctions and modes of the essential Islamic path are discussed, including reflections on the meaning of worship, ritual and the essential drive towards truth, amidst an array of Qur\u2019anic verse references and commentary. The concluding axis of the presentation relates to the completion of the human journey, the fruition of self-knowledge and the arc leading to the discovery of the cosmic soul present in every heart. It is necessary to take reference from the living model that is the prophetic way and conduct yourself as an exemplar of total commitment to living in unison with the essence of life while being appropriately engaged in the changing world. This is a corner stone for adherents to the path of knowledge and truth. Qur'an Direct: Surat Al-Fatt\u0101h Listen Part 2 In this more intimate discourse, Shaykh Fadhlalla weaves a wide range of narratives and reflections together, providing multifaceted insights into the opening chapter of the Qur\u2019an: Al Fatiha. The talk begins by looking at the arc of social history and developments in humanity, framed by the context surrounding the pre-settlement nomadic peoples of the Mediterranean, Middle Eastern basin with a special focus on the nature of prophecy and its relatability to the rise of human consciousness and the Qur\u2019anic unveilings. The Shaykh presents some key Qur\u2019anic maps, such as: Oneness and Duality, symmetries and mirror images, shadows and lights. Thereafter, the subtler linguistic elements of the Fatiha are elaborated with references to a multitude of other Qur\u2019anic segments and chapters. Various key injunctions of the way of Muhammad and latter masters of this path are referenced and tied together so as to present appropriate keys for exploring and enjoying inspirations from the Qur\u2019an. Some of these themes include: the etiquette and courtesy in appropriately approaching the Qur\u2019an; the cosmic nature of bismillah ; and the seamlessness between the scene and unseen reflected in the Qur\u2019anic disclosures. The talk concludes with a description of the essential elements of the prophetic path, the appropriate attitude and prescriptions that go along with constant awareness, a wholesome heart and the living dynamics of accepting limitations and boundaries whilst constantly seeking and connecting to higher consciousness. Qur'an Direct: Ultimate Exposures Listen Part 3 This discourse is a Qur\u2019anic commentary overviewing four key Surahs in the last section of the Qur\u2019an commonly referred to as the Qul\u2019s . The Qur\u2019anic disclosures repeatedly reflect the link between the seen and unseen, relative and absolute. These four-short surahs considered to be foundational and fundamental in the Muhammadi path focus on the nature of Reality and Truth. Shaykh Fadhlalla highlights the Arabic key words in these short surahs and the dimensions and meanings surrounding them and their linguistic roots. Various reflections relating to practice on the essential Islamic path are interweaved with insights around the self, its nature and the keys that increase awareness, watchfulness and access to the light of soul. Qur'an Direct: The 4 Quls Listen Part 4 This discourse is a combination of reflection and commentary on three Surahs from the final section of the Qur\u2019an: Al Zilzal (The earthquake) Al Adiyat (The Chargers) Al Qar\u2019iah (The Calamity) Shaykh Fadhlallah begins by introducing and exploring the nature of Authority and its dynamics from both a cosmic and local perspective as reflected in the Qur\u2019an, which is regarded as \u2018the Authority\u2019 on the Muhammadi path. The appropriate historical, sociological and linguistic modes of approaching the Qur\u2019an are explored in relation to its spectrum of meanings. The Shaykh demonstrates this authoritative approach in a distilled presentation of these Surahs. He highlights the various windows of meaning woven into these verses and connects a range of topics to them which include the temporality of earthly life, the next phase, the singularity of truth, birth and death of the cosmos, freedom and decree in tandem with various key indications regarding the nature of the self and living the path of Qur\u2019an.

A compelling view of Sufi history together with vivid personal remembrances of living mystics. This is an inspiring and at the same time beautifully subtle book, with light-filled insights on every page.\u201d \u2013 Saadi Shakur Chishti, author of The Sufi Book of Life The Sufi path described in this book leads the seeker past ordinary states of consciousness towards a new experience of infinitude that is the source of the universe. In this stage there is no duality or otherness, but instead infinitude, the Original Oneness, from which all dualities and attributes emanate. The book is at once an autobiography, a didactic treatise and a literary opus full of wonderful translations of the words of earlier Sufis, as well as the author\u2019s own poetry. It describes Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri\u2019s life quest to connect today\u2019s world with classical times, especially through his meetings with enlightened Sufis all over the globe. Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri also addresses profound Sufi teachings concerning the nature of humankind, the cosmos and God, using clear and simple language to address difficult doctrinal issues as only a master who has digested fully such knowledge could do. The book also reveals much about the present-day Islamic world where, despite the tragedies that are to be seen everywhere, tradition and spirituality survive. This is a metaphysical and spiritual guide to the Sufi path that ultimately offers insight into the meaning and purpose of life.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"books/biography/sufi-encounters/#purchase","text":"Amazon","title":"Purchase"},{"location":"books/general-islam/","text":"General on Islam This collection of writings by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri offers the contemporary reader an introduction into Islam, the Qur\u2019an, and Sufism.

I'm someone who is constantly reading and learning and found this book to be within a whole new class of its own. Spirituality is not a romantic ideal, but a very real endeavour of tearing away the self accumulated junk; the Shaykh, for me, was able to give me the tools to be able to do this. I particularly resonated with his section on the prayer. He wrote of perspectives that were so unusual they could only be divine and yet upon reflection they were what I needed all along, a transformative interpretation of all that is done within the prayer. My prayers hold a very different meaning since I've read his book. Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri's Response Our wordly experiences are preparations for real life which is akhirah, the entry of it is death. Prostration is the doorway to leaving the mind behind and entering the boundless zone of the soul. The ultimate duty is to live as a soul which illumines body and mind through a purified heart.

Based on the solid foundations of Tawhid (unity) and the Prophetic Traditions, this beautiful book, also now available as an e-book, may be used to enhance our understanding of how the One works in every aspect around us in our world and could help us to establish a deep and sustainable connection with our highest potential, making divine patterns, ways and decrees more accessible to us, at a critical time in mankind's history and conscious evolution. Used with humility and sincerity, it may help us resonate with each majestic and beautiful Name, taking our consciousness to higher realms and through us, the consciousness of the world. For how else do some of Allah's attributes manifest but through our creative thought and action? We are caught in His Names, we may as well use them for our conscious evolution, the benefit of the earth and the rest of creation--just like our beloved Prophet did and the countless other prophets and messengers did before him. So this is an important book. It is a lucid introduction to a profound and vast subject covering aspects of `ibada (worship), the realms of creation and our role as sincere human beings who witness the power and glory and mercy of the One. The book also provides very useful guidelines on the etiquette of supplication: how we must call Him and why sometimes our calling seems to go unheard. The simple layout makes the book very easy as a manual of reference. There is perhaps a little repetition in the introduction but the Names themselves are clearly and simply presented in elegant Arabic calligraphy with English transliteration and translation. There follows a brief etymological (the author's speciality--see the series Keys to The Quran) description, which by no means claims to be comprehensive. After all, how can we \"define\" the Names in the entirety of their depths and meaning? The author is merely giving us a tantalising glimpse of what these Divine Names could mean for us as individuals, and their use in our daily lives, without any esoteric mumbo-jumbo. Highly recommended for Muslims and non-Muslims alike and anyone seeking the tools of judgement and discernment and protection to navigate through our ever-increasingly complex world.","title":"Calling Allah By His Most Beautiful Names"},{"location":"books/practices-teachings/calling-allah-beautiful-names/#calling-allah-by-his-most-beautiful-names","text":"","title":"Calling Allah By His Most Beautiful Names"},{"location":"books/practices-teachings/calling-allah-beautiful-names/#summary","text":"The primal design of human beings is based on an intrinsic knowledge of perfection and its yearning and journeying towards it.

Purchase Paperback and Kindle Amazon E-Book Apple iBookStore Kobo Store Reader's Review By J.K. Lafene The title of this book is arresting, to say the least. It immediately leads us to reflect on the meaning of happiness in this life and to wonder how it is connected to the afterlife. Most people, even believers, think of happiness only in terms of satisfaction with this life. If we have no belief in the afterlife, we concentrate on trying to enjoy this life and avoid thinking much about death. If we are believers we usually have a vague idea that we'll either be forgiven and live in heaven or (if we've been very wicked) will be consigned to Hell. But we hope for and expect mercy and take comfort in the belief that the wicked will get their just deserts! This book gives us a detailed exposition of the nature of the human being in this life, how what we do here is intimately connected to the next life (the real life), and how we can prepare for what will occur after leaving the body, based on the Islamic Sufi interpretation of the teaching of the Holy Qur'an and hadith of the Prophet (saw) and Imams.(as) Prospective readers may say, \"will this book tell me how I can be happy here and hopefully not fear death?\" the answer is 'Certainly', but not in the way they might imagine -- that is, like a 'self-help' book giving advice on 'attributes of effective people' or such like. Such manuals are indeed useful, but this book makes us realise that 'happiness', which it defines as 'consistent inner contentment and peace' and 'witnessing perfection in every situation', is not achieved without considerable effort; but it is unquestionably worth it! Ultimately happiness in this life is \"to be a friend of God and reliant on the sacred light, which 'brings about joy and is beyond fear or sorrow'. How? In his description of human nature and levels of consciousness, the author stresses how aligning the self, or ego, with the soul, or higher consciousness, through self-awareness and obedience to God-given laws of behaviour, will lead to stability and inner light. This must be worked on in this life so that we prepare for the next. We cannot be 'happy' in the afterlife if we have been selfish and heedless in this one. The last section of the book describes the Qur'anic teachings about the afterlife, the period immediately after death, the resurrection and the ultimate return to Allah. We are told we need have no fear if our self has been aligned to our soul through \"faith, trust in god, good deeds, transformative worship, purity of heart and other religious acts...\" finally we need simply to surrender to the Absolute. On p 125 (of the printed copy of this book) we are told that the Prophet described four qualities which will help us remain in peace on the day of judgment.

Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri makes difficult concepts accessible, especially through the use of metaphors, allegories, and insights from modern science. His thesis is that human consciousness manifests in several ways across a spectrum that ranges from universal supreme consciousness to personal conditioned consciousness. It is the nature of human culture, thought and personal consciousness to continually operate in a dualistic way, so that Reality is obscured by several layers of fragmentation. The ultimate harmony of human consciousness with universal reality is the challenge of existence. Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri illustrates that we can heal the split between individual and the universal by recognising that each is essential to its different territory, and believes that 'spirit' is the causal factor from which all states arise.

Purchase Paperback and Kindle Amazon E-Book Apple iBookStore Kobo Store Reader Review By Nazo Hadi I am a born Muslim and was exposed to the Qur'an from an early age, but I was never satisfied with the commentaries I read. The Qur'an seemed to talk about events in the past, but I wanted to know how it relates to my life in this time and age. In most commentaries the commentators follow the chapters and verses. In this book, Shaykh Fadhlalla has chosen topics which are important to everyday life and selected and collected all the verses relevant to those topics in the appendix at the end of the book, I found this approach very helpful when I wanted to look up what the Qur'an says about a certain topic. The central theme of the Qur'an is its emphasis on Allah/God as the One source and Essence that permeates the entire universe. All manifestations come from Allah, are sustained by Him and return to Him. The entire universe is in submission to Allah. According to the Qur'an our job is to groom the ego and adhere to His laws and regulations so that we become aware of the Divine Presence at all times. This book is useful for serious Muslims and anyone who is interested to know the basic message of the Qur'an. It is a very good introduction for beginners and inspires one to read and have a better understanding of the Qur'an. It has led me to listen to the Shaykh's other commentaries on his website and has transformed my life. For example, his commentary on Surah Al-Imran -- 3: 179 -- to accept the present and trust in Allah for the future has helped me to deal with a lot of worry and anxiety in my life and given me peace of mind. In addition it has changed my relationship with the Qur'an so that now I actually enjoy reading it.","title":"The Essential Message Of the Qur\u2019an"},{"location":"books/quran/essential-quran/#the-essential-message-of-the-quran","text":"","title":"The Essential Message Of the Qur'an"},{"location":"books/quran/essential-quran/#summary","text":"The Essential Message of the Qur\u2019an captures the spiritual significance of the sacred text of Islam and how it inspired countless millions across the ages.

It was a result of teachings and talks with the objective of exploring the deeper meanings of the Divine revelations. The emphasis had been on the key Qur`anic terms and the subtle facets and connotations of Arabic words. The response by the readers was most encouraging. The new millennium opens in an age of great complexities, chaos and constant change in values and the way of life. Therefore, what is needed nowadays is the re-discovery of Allah\u2019s patterns as revealed in the Qur\u2019anic message so that we can act appropriately in this world. The message of the Qur\u2019an emanates from the original Divine blueprint which also lies latent in the human heart. All of us seek the path of ease, knowledge, security, love and contentment. No happiness lasts unless it is based on the knowledge of Allah and submission to His intended purpose and ways. The Qur`an is the key to this awakening. Reality, or Allah, is not found in one particular place where we have to go in order to be near. It says in the Qur\u2019an: \u201cI am closer to you than your jugular vein\u201d \u2013 50:16. What is stopping us from knowing Allah is ourselves. We are far because of the so-called \u201cI\u201d which constantly asserts itself. We must kill our \u201cself\u201d first while still alive, through surrender. We must be willing to totally surrender, from our hearts, if even for one moment. All the practices of the people of Allah are nothing but techniques to enable us to reach that state, to sit still with no thoughts, and to be pure energy. Summary These commentaries on several essential chapters of the Qur'an are based on Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri's teachings in the West. The chapters include Surahs Fatiha, Baqarah, Al Imran, Yaseen, Al Ankabut, Al Rahman,Al Waqiah, Al Mulk and the entire Juz Amma (last section of the Qur'an). These explorations of selected chapters of the Qur\u2019an are aimed at those seeking guidance and transformation in the modern world. Emphasising the timeless wisdom of the Qur\u2019an, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri uses the linguistic roots of the key terms to offer illuminating insights into its deep inner meanings, and shows its relevance to our present day lives. As a source of understanding for both Muslims and non-Muslims, this volume of 5 parts will be greatly valued.

Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri makes difficult concepts accessible, especially through the use of metaphors, allegories, and insights from modern science. His thesis is that human consciousness manifests in several ways across a spectrum that ranges from universal supreme consciousness to personal conditioned consciousness. It is the nature of human culture, thought and personal consciousness to continually operate in a dualistic way, so that Reality is obscured by several layers of fragmentation. The ultimate harmony of human consciousness with universal reality is the challenge of existence.

Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri makes difficult concepts accessible, especially through the use of metaphors, allegories, and insights from modern science. His thesis is that human consciousness manifests in several ways across a spectrum that ranges from universal supreme consciousness to personal conditioned consciousness. It is the nature of human culture, thought and personal consciousness to continually operate in a dualistic way, so that Reality is obscured by several layers of fragmentation. The ultimate harmony of human consciousness with universal reality is the challenge of existence.

Witnessing Perfection addresses the concerns of those who are aware that an urgent redress in the balance between head and heart is needed and who comprehend that this can only be fulfilled by personal spiritual development. Purchase Paperback Amazon E-Book Amazon Apple iBookStore Kobo Store Reader Review By Hasan Joban The quest for lasting, durable happiness and contentment is very much a part of human nature. It could be argued that every human action, no matter how it manifests, is an attempt at echoing this primal impulse for experiencing peace and joy. Occasionally, we manage to capture the blissful moment, only to see it wriggle from our clutches and replaced all-too-quickly by longer periods of agitation, turbulence and anxiety. In Witnessing Perfection, Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri provides a road map for the journey of life that can facilitate the experiencing of this state of durable peace. The opening lines of the Introduction set the scene: \"Lasting fulfilment can only be achieved when an aspect of perfection is perceived within every moment. Every moment contains a glimpse of perfection\". What follows through subsequent pages is the unfolding of a formula, immersed in spiritual wisdom, which discusses such issues as the nature of the self, the relationship between self and soul, the family, civilizations and cultures, and the ultimate goal of personal transformation through self-knowledge. However, it is only by constant reference to an internal unifying essence underpinning everything, Shaykh Fadhlalla points out, that lasting happiness can be experienced. This is a recurring theme. In essence, what we learn is that the more our intentions, thoughts and actions are wedded to this pristine reference point within us, the greater the likelihood of achieving durable bliss. How does this exactly happen? Shaykh Fadhlalla explains: \"The journey of the spiritual seeker begins by looking for meaning and patterns behind events, feelings and experiences. The compass of this journey is the reference to the essence of life, which is the soul within the human's heart. When all dualities and opposites are seen through this unified lens, all of these experiences and events will change in meaning and significance. Conflicts, difficulties and disappointments will no longer bring about undue suffering and emotional reactions. This new state of authentic understanding enables the person to interact wisely with the outer world, whilst experiencing harmony and ease at heart. The door to the magnificent present moment and the joy therein begins to open\" (p. xv-xvi). The book outlines a broad map to reaching this magnificent moment. There is a wealth of teaching emanating from the pages, punctuated by frequent aphorisms that glisten in their wisdom. This book is not meant to be read cover to cover in one sitting and then returned to the bookshelf; instead, it needs to be placed within arm's reach so that it can be delved into again and again for deep and frequent reflection. As the author explains, \"To fully benefit and be transformed by this book you need to read, reflect and apply what touches and benefits you most... Apply what is relevant to you at the time and trust that there is perfection within every situation and experience\". (p. xv). What impact has this book had on me personally? I have had this book for a while now; I refer to it frequently and can say that it has had a deep and transformative impact. One benefit that I would like to share is that I am comforted by the meaning of the self as expounded in the book. It provides me with a map by which to understand the nature of my own emotions, thoughts, desires, anxieties, and so on. This perspective helps me to identify when I might be getting overwhelmed by my own feelings of insecurity and inadequacy, or blaming others for my misfortune, and therefore enables me to change my thinking accordingly. It helps me to reflect upon the feelings of affliction as indicating whether I am aligned to the pristine essence within or not. Thus, rather than reacting in a knee-jerk fashion, I might take a moment to reflect and then act appropriately, as befits the perfect moment! In my view, to be guided to cultivate that attitude alone makes Witnessing Perfection worth having. This book comes highly recommended to anyone who is interested in self-knowledge, personal transformation, and a desire to partake in a healthy and balanced life.","title":"Witnessing Perfection: A Sufi Guide"},{"location":"books/sufism/witnessing-perfection/#witnessing-perfection-a-sufi-guide","text":"","title":"Witnessing Perfection: A Sufi Guide"},{"location":"books/sufism/witnessing-perfection/#summary","text":"Annotated and includes sections of the Holy Qur\u2019an and Prophetic (SAW) Traditions.

The Qur'an provides more insight: \u201cSay: Travel in the earth and see how He makes the first creation, then Allah creates the latter creation; surely Allah has power over all things.\u201d \u2013 29:20 In every way it is a blessing to travel. In the Shadhili tariqa , the masters never slept in one place for more than three weeks, so as not to take what was around them for granted. Haraka ma\u2019a-l-baraka : movement is with blessing. Man must change, he must move on so that he does not become a slave of outer habits and become fixated. Man is attracted to fixation because he loves the permanent, the ever-fixed within him. But to desire preservation of outer fixation is ignorance. The outer can never be fixed. No sooner does man try to control an event than he finds it beyond his power to do so. Man wants to know the permanent but he mistakenly tries to bring it about in his environment by establishing rigid habits. At the lowest, most superficial level, travel disturbs this tendency. The earth would be sterile if it were not disturbed, if it were not plowed. The same thing applies to man\u2019s heart. If it is not disturbed, if it is not cut off from its desires and attachments, how can it resonate and keep turning? At first one resents being cut off, but the purpose of one\u2019s life is to move both outwardly and inwardly; outwardly by having dynamic attitudes toward the world and the earth, and inwardly by being willing to turn away from what the self desires. Hajj The word hajj literally means \"endeavor, aspiration, intention, destination, object, goal, aim\". In Islam it means: \u2018to intend to go to the House of Allah to carry out specific rituals which are to be executed within a certain time frame.\u2019 In a spiritual sense hajj is endeavoring to reach a station whose meaning, magnitude and true essence cannot be expressed or explained because of the lack of words to describe it. For this reason there are few who speak of it. In The Lantern of the Path , Imam Ja`far al\u2011Sadiq said: \"If you want to make the Pilgrimage then empty your heart before your departure of every distraction and concealing veil and turn all your affairs over to your Creator and trust in Him\u2026\" \"\u2026then wash your sins away with the water of sincere repentance and don the garments of truth, purity and humility.\" `Umrah This is the voluntary visit to the Ka`bah at other times of the year. The word `umrah is from the Arabic three letter root `AMR, which means to construct, build and inhabit, implying \u2018flourishing, inhabiting, giving life to, populating, and building\u2019. Thus, `umrah means to cause to flourish and to be enlivened by one\u2019s presence at the Ka`bah. The Ka`bah is a metaphor for divine impenetrability and for this reason there is no fear for the one who is present there. It is the Fortress of Eternal Truth \u2013 everlasting and perfect. Whoever performs the `Umrah is not obliged to perform the Pause at `Arafah, but only the Taw\u0101f and the Hastening Between Stations, and does not leave Makkah before visiting the House many times. This represents the passion for Allah\u2019s Names and Attributes which encompass the universe and the Ka`bah is its centre. Going to Madinah and to the Presence of Muhammad is not considered complementary to the House of Allah, because the prophetic presence is a manifestation of the Presence of Oneness. The enlightened seeker sees through the Muhammadi Presence, and his spiritual insight witnesses the Presence of Oneness \u2013 the Unique Absolute One. As his outer is within the shari`ah, his soul is within the tariqah and his Innermost is within the haqiqah. Reflecting upon \u2018Muhammad the Messenger of Allah \u2019 will reveal that \u2018Muhammad\u2019 represents the Physical Universe and the \u2018Messenger\u2019 (ras\u016bl) represents the Spiritual Realms, and that \u2018Allah\u2019 represents the Realm of Power. Thus, whoever knows the haqiqah of Muhammad knows the entire truth. Muhrim The muhrim (one who is in a state of ihr\u0101m ) journeys in a state of complete obedience, calling out the words of the talbiyah : \"Labayka\" (Here I am, at Your service!), until s/he arrives at the Ka`bah, the House of Allah, which is a state of Oneness. Then s/he discontinues the call because of having completely vanished within the House: his/her presence melts into the unique oneness of the House, which is the focus of all creation. The black stone is a metaphor of universal relationships. It is a representation of star dust which is the structure of our earth and our bodies. Al-Ihr\u0101m This is considered the first of the four spiritual Pillars of the Pilgrimage. It is the act of entering the process of the Pilgrimage. It is thus called because the person making the pilgrimage abstains from shaving, cutting fingernails, hunting, and having sexual relations. It also refers to the donning of a garment, usually of white cotton, wool or linen, worn during the performance of the Pilgrimage. Its significance is that all things which are permitted (hal\u0101l) are forbidden (har\u0101m), in addition to what is already forbidden, to the person of this station while he is wearing the white garment, out of reverence for the sanctity of Allah. The people of gnosis consider it to mean the exodus from every circumstance, whether it be exalted or lowly or whether it be related to time or space. This is often referred to as \u2018Freedom from Surroundings\u2019. If the person of this station does not exit from the limitations of time and space and from the external world of phenomena he will not arrive at his destination. All human experiences occur within the realm of phenomena. Outside of it there is no time or space, because Allah existed when there was no time and no space, and He remains unchanged. This entire realm of existence, with respect to His Magnitude and Glory, is no more than a mustard seed or smaller. Taw\u0101f This is the second of the four spiritual Pillars of Pilgrimage. The word in this context signifies the return to the Manifestation of the Essence which is worthy of Divinity ( ul\u016bhiyah ), and which is described in terms related to meaning and spirituality, travelling through the realm of meaning, and the various qualities of the manifestations of the Creator and the creation. The taw\u0101f is also a journey of reflection into the inter-relatedness of the seven key Attributes (Living, Knowing, Willing, Able, Communicating, Seeing, Hearing), the characteristics of their composition, and the dependence of one upon the other. When the pilgrim enters the Sanctuary he finds the six directions (i.e. north, south, east, west, above and below) all facing towards the Ka`bah. If it is like this for the seeker, how is it for the Master who has vanished within the Essence of his Creator and who represents Allah in his words? Everything which issues forth from the tongues of the Masters comes from the beams issuing forth from the Presence of the Unique Oneness. Sa`y This is the third of the four spiritual pillars of the pilgrimage. Hastening between the stations of the Pilgrimage, which are called Saf\u0101 and Marwa , refers to the fluctuation of the Master between Allah\u2019s Beauty ( jam\u0101l ) and His Glory and Majesty ( jal\u0101l ) to the point where Glory becomes the essence of Beauty because of his having abandoned his self, not to mention his own will and freedom of choice. This fluctuation between Beauty and Majesty represents the Masters\u2019 rank of perfection. Their movement represents the Hand of Allah\u2019s concern and His protection in both states. In spite of the lofty position of the Masters, they are not seduced by what they have already attained from the taw\u0101f and their immersion in the Presence of Oneness. Majesty and Beauty do not affect them because they are part of them, in contrast to others for whom this state would represent a tribulation. He who is with Allah loves Allah\u2019s constriction as well as His expansion, and sees both of them as being natural occurrences like night and day, as they are both necessary conditions of experiencing being-ness. Constriction is an attribute of the physical while expansion is an attribute of the spiritual. The Master lets the station seek him out and does not try to seek it out. The station was created for him he was not created for the station. He is concerned exclusively with the glorification of Allah and allows everything else to serve him in his dedication. Wuq\u016bf This is the stopping place or Pause of the Pilgrimage on the plains of \u2018Arafat. As the Prophet said: \"The Pilgrimage is `Arafah.\" After completing Taw\u0101f and Sa`y , the Master is overcome by a state above which there is no higher condition or increase, which is the abandonment of anything known to him beyond the ability to describe. In this station of absolute abandonment, he is ordered to give up his physical form, his soul, his self, his reasoning, the names as well as the Attributes, and anything which has the scent of manifestation; he is commanded to gatheredness and to enfold the outward within the inward and the inward in the outward. When he has realized this state then he has completed the climb up the mountain, which is referred to as the Pause. It is also referred to as \u2018The Blindness\u2019 because it is absolute non\u2011existence, witnessing neither creation nor Creator. The Pause is a station beyond reasoning, and therefore impossible to express, that it has been called the \u2018obscure\u2019, the \u2018amazement\u2019, the \u2018bewilderment\u2019, the \u2018obliteration\u2019, and the \u2018Realm of L\u0101h\u016bt \u2019 (Pure Unity). People of Allah are in wonderment at the mention of it, unable to describe it as if they were deaf and dumb and powerless to reason. `Arafah, then, is the station of the Pause and the final goal of total annihilation (or complete vanishing from existence). The Pause occurs after zuhr (midday prayer time) and after the vanishing of existence ( zaww\u0101l ): \"When the sun is rolled up and the stars are cast adrift.\" Qur'an, 81:1\u20112 This is the station of obliteration and blindness, of which the Prophet said: \"Indeed, it is the station of blindness (with) no atmosphere above it or below it.\" As this station is incomprehensible and full of awe one must exit from it as soon as possible, remaining merely for a pause. The seeker must then hasten to the place of nearness: Muzdalifah . \"Flee from it (`Arafah) to the Place of Nearness (Muzdalifah) lest you vanish within it.\" Thus, it is cried out in bewilderment: \"O my Lord, from the standpoint of the Truth of Existence, You are the Worshipper and You are the Worshipped, You are the Witness and the Witnessed.\" After this, the seeker must hasten to Makkah, which is referred to as the Presence of Oneness, in order to cease his wandering, attain a sense of security, bathe, and pray his sunrise prayer. This concludes all four spiritual Pillars of the Pilgrimage. A\u1e63-\u1e63af\u0101 and Al-marwah Throughout your life you run back and forth between two opposite things, like a\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101 and al-Marwah . A\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101 and al-Marwah are two clusters of rocks between which the pilgrim runs back and forth. They are the scene of Hajar\u2019s running to and fro in search of water, after being left alone with \u2018Ismail in the blistering heat and wilderness of Mecca. They figuratively bracket all human efforts, from hunger to fullness, from illness to wellness, and man\u2019s patience and tawakkul (trust, confidence) in Allah are tested through running between them. A\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101 and al-Marwah , and the practice of sa\u2019y (running between the two of them), are indeed true signs of Allah. Man performs sa\u2019y throughout his life in his constant search for true contentment, seeking it outwardly, not knowing that the access to it is already within him.","title":"Journey Words"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#journey-words","text":"","title":"Journey Words"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#sair","text":"The most direct translation of this word is \"travel\".

At first one resents being cut off, but the purpose of one\u2019s life is to move both outwardly and inwardly; outwardly by having dynamic attitudes toward the world and the earth, and inwardly by being willing to turn away from what the self desires.","title":"Sa\u2019ir"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#hajj","text":"The word hajj literally means \"endeavor, aspiration, intention, destination, object, goal, aim\". In Islam it means: \u2018to intend to go to the House of Allah to carry out specific rituals which are to be executed within a certain time frame.\u2019 In a spiritual sense hajj is endeavoring to reach a station whose meaning, magnitude and true essence cannot be expressed or explained because of the lack of words to describe it. For this reason there are few who speak of it. In The Lantern of the Path , Imam Ja`far al\u2011Sadiq said: \"If you want to make the Pilgrimage then empty your heart before your departure of every distraction and concealing veil and turn all your affairs over to your Creator and trust in Him\u2026\" \"\u2026then wash your sins away with the water of sincere repentance and don the garments of truth, purity and humility.\"","title":"Hajj"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#umrah","text":"This is the voluntary visit to the Ka`bah at other times of the year. The word `umrah is from the Arabic three letter root `AMR, which means to construct, build and inhabit, implying \u2018flourishing, inhabiting, giving life to, populating, and building\u2019. Thus, `umrah means to cause to flourish and to be enlivened by one\u2019s presence at the Ka`bah. The Ka`bah is a metaphor for divine impenetrability and for this reason there is no fear for the one who is present there. It is the Fortress of Eternal Truth \u2013 everlasting and perfect. Whoever performs the `Umrah is not obliged to perform the Pause at `Arafah, but only the Taw\u0101f and the Hastening Between Stations, and does not leave Makkah before visiting the House many times. This represents the passion for Allah\u2019s Names and Attributes which encompass the universe and the Ka`bah is its centre. Going to Madinah and to the Presence of Muhammad is not considered complementary to the House of Allah, because the prophetic presence is a manifestation of the Presence of Oneness. The enlightened seeker sees through the Muhammadi Presence, and his spiritual insight witnesses the Presence of Oneness \u2013 the Unique Absolute One. As his outer is within the shari`ah, his soul is within the tariqah and his Innermost is within the haqiqah. Reflecting upon \u2018Muhammad the Messenger of Allah \u2019 will reveal that \u2018Muhammad\u2019 represents the Physical Universe and the \u2018Messenger\u2019 (ras\u016bl) represents the Spiritual Realms, and that \u2018Allah\u2019 represents the Realm of Power.

Then s/he discontinues the call because of having completely vanished within the House: his/her presence melts into the unique oneness of the House, which is the focus of all creation.

It is the act of entering the process of the Pilgrimage. It is thus called because the person making the pilgrimage abstains from shaving, cutting fingernails, hunting, and having sexual relations. It also refers to the donning of a garment, usually of white cotton, wool or linen, worn during the performance of the Pilgrimage. Its significance is that all things which are permitted (hal\u0101l) are forbidden (har\u0101m), in addition to what is already forbidden, to the person of this station while he is wearing the white garment, out of reverence for the sanctity of Allah. The people of gnosis consider it to mean the exodus from every circumstance, whether it be exalted or lowly or whether it be related to time or space. This is often referred to as \u2018Freedom from Surroundings\u2019. If the person of this station does not exit from the limitations of time and space and from the external world of phenomena he will not arrive at his destination. All human experiences occur within the realm of phenomena. Outside of it there is no time or space, because Allah existed when there was no time and no space, and He remains unchanged. This entire realm of existence, with respect to His Magnitude and Glory, is no more than a mustard seed or smaller.","title":"Al-Ihr\u0101m"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#tawaf","text":"This is the second of the four spiritual Pillars of Pilgrimage. The word in this context signifies the return to the Manifestation of the Essence which is worthy of Divinity ( ul\u016bhiyah ), and which is described in terms related to meaning and spirituality, travelling through the realm of meaning, and the various qualities of the manifestations of the Creator and the creation. The taw\u0101f is also a journey of reflection into the inter-relatedness of the seven key Attributes (Living, Knowing, Willing, Able, Communicating, Seeing, Hearing), the characteristics of their composition, and the dependence of one upon the other. When the pilgrim enters the Sanctuary he finds the six directions (i.e. north, south, east, west, above and below) all facing towards the Ka`bah. If it is like this for the seeker, how is it for the Master who has vanished within the Essence of his Creator and who represents Allah in his words? Everything which issues forth from the tongues of the Masters comes from the beams issuing forth from the Presence of the Unique Oneness.","title":"Taw\u0101f"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#sa96y","text":"This is the third of the four spiritual pillars of the pilgrimage. Hastening between the stations of the Pilgrimage, which are called Saf\u0101 and Marwa , refers to the fluctuation of the Master between Allah\u2019s Beauty ( jam\u0101l ) and His Glory and Majesty ( jal\u0101l ) to the point where Glory becomes the essence of Beauty because of his having abandoned his self, not to mention his own will and freedom of choice. This fluctuation between Beauty and Majesty represents the Masters\u2019 rank of perfection. Their movement represents the Hand of Allah\u2019s concern and His protection in both states. In spite of the lofty position of the Masters, they are not seduced by what they have already attained from the taw\u0101f and their immersion in the Presence of Oneness. Majesty and Beauty do not affect them because they are part of them, in contrast to others for whom this state would represent a tribulation. He who is with Allah loves Allah\u2019s constriction as well as His expansion, and sees both of them as being natural occurrences like night and day, as they are both necessary conditions of experiencing being-ness. Constriction is an attribute of the physical while expansion is an attribute of the spiritual. The Master lets the station seek him out and does not try to seek it out. The station was created for him he was not created for the station. He is concerned exclusively with the glorification of Allah and allows everything else to serve him in his dedication.","title":"Sa`y"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#wuquf","text":"This is the stopping place or Pause of the Pilgrimage on the plains of \u2018Arafat. As the Prophet said: \"The Pilgrimage is `Arafah.\" After completing Taw\u0101f and Sa`y , the Master is overcome by a state above which there is no higher condition or increase, which is the abandonment of anything known to him beyond the ability to describe. In this station of absolute abandonment, he is ordered to give up his physical form, his soul, his self, his reasoning, the names as well as the Attributes, and anything which has the scent of manifestation; he is commanded to gatheredness and to enfold the outward within the inward and the inward in the outward. When he has realized this state then he has completed the climb up the mountain, which is referred to as the Pause. It is also referred to as \u2018The Blindness\u2019 because it is absolute non\u2011existence, witnessing neither creation nor Creator. The Pause is a station beyond reasoning, and therefore impossible to express, that it has been called the \u2018obscure\u2019, the \u2018amazement\u2019, the \u2018bewilderment\u2019, the \u2018obliteration\u2019, and the \u2018Realm of L\u0101h\u016bt \u2019 (Pure Unity). People of Allah are in wonderment at the mention of it, unable to describe it as if they were deaf and dumb and powerless to reason. `Arafah, then, is the station of the Pause and the final goal of total annihilation (or complete vanishing from existence). The Pause occurs after zuhr (midday prayer time) and after the vanishing of existence ( zaww\u0101l ): \"When the sun is rolled up and the stars are cast adrift.\" Qur'an, 81:1\u20112 This is the station of obliteration and blindness, of which the Prophet said: \"Indeed, it is the station of blindness (with) no atmosphere above it or below it.\" As this station is incomprehensible and full of awe one must exit from it as soon as possible, remaining merely for a pause. The seeker must then hasten to the place of nearness: Muzdalifah . \"Flee from it (`Arafah) to the Place of Nearness (Muzdalifah) lest you vanish within it.\" Thus, it is cried out in bewilderment: \"O my Lord, from the standpoint of the Truth of Existence, You are the Worshipper and You are the Worshipped, You are the Witness and the Witnessed.\" After this, the seeker must hasten to Makkah, which is referred to as the Presence of Oneness, in order to cease his wandering, attain a sense of security, bathe, and pray his sunrise prayer. This concludes all four spiritual Pillars of the Pilgrimage.","title":"Wuq\u016bf"},{"location":"glossary/journey-words/#as-safa-and-al-marwah","text":"Throughout your life you run back and forth between two opposite things, like a\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101 and al-Marwah .

Fa\u1e6dara also means \"to create\". Non-creation cracked and split open to reveal its opposite, creation. Basic knowledge is Fi\u1e6dr\u012b, connected with the pre-creational crack. Access to Basic knowledge is through diving deep into the well to reach the source of the spring where the original crack is. The Saf\u012bh, the foolish, ignorant one whose life is cluttered and whose well is filled up with the debris of illusions, desires, attachments and covetousness, has no access to that original crack, that fi\u1e6drah. R\u016b\u1e25 R\u016b\u1e25 means \u201cspirit, soul.\u201d It is related to r\u012b\u1e25 , which means \u201cwind.\u201d R\u0101\u1e25ah , which means \u201ccomfort, contentment, or ease,\u201d also comes from the same root, as does the word r\u0101\u2019i\u1e25ah , which means \u201cperfume\u201d and mirwa\u1e25ah , which means \u201cfan.\u201d The implication here is that the spirit is like a wind; it is as subtle as a summer breeze. The spirit is blown into the body and later blown out of it. Like the wind, its subtlety is balanced by its forcefulness. It says in the Qur\u2019an: \u201cThey ask you about the soul. Say: the soul is one of the commands of my Lord\u201d (17:85). On that Night of Power the All-Mighty, All-Powerful Lord extends His mercy of knowledge and opens up the skies, and the angelic powers and forces fulfill their merciful duty of bringing forth clearly the message and knowledge of taw\u1e25\u012bd and the command and control of the Lord. Sajdah Closeness to Allah is by sajdah, by prostration, which is the outer proof of inner abandonment. Outer prostration is the manifestation of an inner state; if it is not, it becomes an empty ritual. Sajada, the root of sajdah, also means \u201cto obey,\u201d meaning to obey the purpose of existence. The purpose of existence is merciful and benign. Another meaning of sajada is \u201cto submit,\u201d and through that submission comes freedom. The only freedom is the recognition of no freedom. The only freedom is the direct inner recognition that there is absolutely no possibility of freedom. From that comes the ultimate freedom and release which is the real and infinite freedom, freedom that is beyond our creation and after our end. Our purpose is to be in that state of inward drunkenness and outward sobriety, inward abandonment and outward courtesy and correctness. In this state we become awareness itself, not aware of something. This then is the outer manifestation of sajdah, of prostration, which is spontaneous. It is the only human position and it is the final as well as the first human position. Fajr Fajr means \u201cdawn, the first light of the morning.\u201d Fajara, the root of fajr, means \u201cto crack, to break out, to explode.\u201d The state of the heart of the knower is hidden in the darkness of the night but is illumined inwardly. It is outwardly in darkness yet bright with inner light, outwardly quiet but inwardly active and dynamic in the sea of knowledge. Most spiritual work is done from late at night until the dawn, when outwardly there is the least physical action and therefore a maximum possibility for inner action. The root of everything lies in its opposite. The root of the most beautiful, soft, white, ravishing lily lies in mud just as the root of maximal inner action lies in outer quietude. From the knowledge that all creation exists according to a measure and is moving toward a destiny according to that measure, comes the peace of certainty. This inner certainty, which illumines all possible outer manifestations, brings about an equilibrium and balance that renders the awakened being in a state full of harmony and unity. The meaning of that peace, which is the result of knowledge, resides inherently in every heart. For the seed to be unearthed, the heart must be purified and made open. The seeker of the knowledge of Allah spends his days of darkness and nights of vigil awaiting the descent of the opening, and when that occurs it is like the crack of dawn. Dhikr The Arabic word for remembrance is dhikr . Remembrance is of several types or levels. There is the remembrance of physical things, which are in front of us, and there is the remembrance of one\u2019s desires, anxieties, and so on. Along the spiritual path, remembrance relates to that which is in one\u2019s innate nature. It is the remembrance of the Essence of Allah the Almighty, of the Source of all manifestations and attributes. That source is within everybody. On the Sufi path, one is required to dis-remember everything else that is discernible, everything that is other than Allah, in order to return to the original remembrance. The Arabic word for remembrance of Allah is dhikru\u2019llah. So the original remembrance of Allah is already in every heart, whether one is aware of it or not. Through the guidance of a spiritual master, the seeker is led beyond, to a level where there is no remembrance of anything that is mentionable. Then that which has always been there, encompassing everything, is eventually experienced and witnessed. The purpose of Sufi practices is to be spontaneously aware of the absolute or central reality as well as remaining aware of the physical and material limitations of the phenomenal world which surrounds us. One is an inner awareness beyond the senses and the other is an outer awareness which is based on senses. Qadr and Qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 \"Certainly, We sent it down on the Night of the Decree.\" The Power that created all the creational systems made them according to a measure, the Decree or qadr , by which all creational manifestations are brought to their destiny, qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 , and final judgment. In the above ayat we are given a glimpse into an aspect of the meaning of qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 wa qadr (destiny and decree). Qa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019 means \u201cfate, destiny, judgment, justice, decree,\u201d and \u201cthat which has passed,\u201d and while qadr means \u201cmeasure, decree,\u201d it also means \u201cdestiny\u201d because it is according to a measure that things unfold and develop. The judgment, or the final destiny, of any created thing follows according to its measure, its qadr , for if it did not, there would be chaos. These measures may fluctuate and interweave within definite bounds, but there must be a measure in order for man to know the limits and to gain knowledge of the world. Laylat al-qadr is the Night of Power, or the Night of the Decree. The knowledge of what is written descended on the night of power and was made known to the Prophet Muhammad, \u1e63alla-ll\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa \u0101lihi wa salaam . Thus it is the night when he was empowered with knowledge, the night when the hidden tablet was unveiled to him. The night of qadr occurs according to each person\u2019s capacity. \u201cThe Night of the Decree\u201d is that night of revelation when the heart opens, when the tablet within man\u2019s heart is unveiled, when the direct recognition that there is only Allah, and that everything which comes into creation comes through that single power, is experienced. This tablet does not contain encyclopedic information: it contains direct knowledge. Eid The word Eid appears only once in the Qur\u2019an, in Surah Ma\u00b4idah . It is the story of the sincere followers of the Prophet Isa. They ask him: \"Can\u2019t you bring upon us from the unseen a banquet or a meal, or some nourishment? We want to taste of it so that our hearts become completely certain that all of it is from Allah.\" So Isa asks his Lord to bring down a heavenly banquet \u2013 an Eid , not only for those who came first but also for those of later time. We always quest the proof of the connection between the seen and the unseen, as our soul is heavenly but living on earth. This is the meaning of Eid . The Arabic root is aada , \u2018to have returned\u2019. Return to what? All of us, who have fasted, tend to return once more towards over indulgence. This is not an interesting return. What is worthwhile to return to is the original condition of Adam in the Garden. We need to move towards that Eid . \u1e62adr \u1e62adr (plural \u1e63ud\u016br) is the chest or breast, that part of one which faces what confronts one. It is where the battles and dramas take place. It must be remembered that every drama is self-created. Every imaginable human role stirs in the breast of man: the king, the despot, the afflicted, the jealous, the strong, the doubter, and the complainer. We have to take refuge from these, take refuge in the Lord Whose mercy brings us to the recognition that everything which occurs, visible and invisible, occurs according to a just system, according to perfect laws which govern this passage, this journey through the creation.","title":"Key Words"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#key-words","text":"","title":"Key Words"},{"location":"glossary/key-words/#fitrah","text":"Fi\u1e6drah is the \"natural and basic disposition\" of humankind and is derived from fa\u1e6dara, to split or break apart, hence If\u1e6d\u0101r, \"breaking of the fast\".

No-one can tell you who you are. It is important that you read the article Less is More and reflect fully on it before you go through these prescriptions. Note 2 : This article is an extract from the book \"Journey of the Self\" . If it piques your interest, you should buy the book, as these particular maps of the self and its journeys falls into the 4 th of 5 stages of development in both microcosm (human self) and macrocosm (the cosmos). These stages are: Absolute Unitive Reality, Inner Dependence, Outer Dependence, Interdependence, and Inner Reliance. The guide provided below is but a small part of a larger story, as is always the case. If you prefer listenting to reading, we highly recommend the audio series \" Refinement of Character \", which covers similar topics in a different format. The Seven Kinds of Self The models below are only meant as examples to guide. The stages within a given model naturally overlap, and the entire spectrum within the model remains active to varying degrees of intensity within the human throughout one's life. In the first model, for example, the saint is not exempt from recognising a glimpse of the commanding self within. The self is like the layers of an onion. We remove one layer, and then another, and so on for our whole life. With each removal, the next layer becomes slightly easier to peel away. The outer layers are the hard ones. The more we unpeel, i.e. the more we undress ourselves of our own superimposed layers of personality, the freer and happier we become and the greater the chance of real fulfillment. Ultimately, when we reach a high state of inner awareness and when we have been truly and totally immersed in that state, that inner equilibrium, we have little or no clutter left in us and that is like reaching the last, inner layer of the onion. If we now take off that layer, what is there? Space! 1 - The Commanding Self The first and lowest station is that of the commanding self ( al-nafs al-ammara ). This is the station of one who is not sufficiently developed inwardly, who is crude and childish, base, egoistic and selfish, with little concern or connection with other than self-gratification. This is the self that is dominated by the physical body, and follows mainly the gratification of sensual pleasure and fleeting desires. This state draws the heart towards its lower and negative extreme. This facet of the self is the abode of most vices and the source of all bad characters. The characteristics of the commanding self encompass meanness, greed, envy, jealousy, ignorance, self-importance, pride, glory, presumption, arrogance, sensuality, anger, violence, insensitivity, lack of insight, and vile manners, interference in what does not concern one, making fun and mocking others, avarice, hatred, qualities of rigidity and dogma, opacity, and the inability to be reached or to form stable relationships. The colour related to the commanding self is blue. It is the blue of intense heat in the middle of the flame. 2 - The Reproachful Self The second station is the reproachful self ( al-nafs al-lawwama ). In this station, the self develops some sense of right and wrong. It begins to have glimpses into its own conduct and occasionally even blames itself for wrong behaviour. The reproachful self does have some measure of awareness and discrimination, but that reproach usually occurs after the event. It is like a crack, so to speak, in the solid frame of the commanding self, that gives rise to the reproachful self with a slight degree of flexibility and awareness. Its characteristics are acting upon whims of the moment, conceit, having to do with self-image, vanity, injustice, bias, backbiting, slander, lying, and excessive love of leadership. Its colour is yellow. This colour is located on the edge of the flame and represents descending and decaying energy. 3 - The Inspired Self The third station is the inspired self ( al-nafs al-mulhamma ). This condition of the self is supple and dynamic, and therefore leads to vulnerability. It is an interspace between good and bad. The keeping of good company and right guidance is necessary at this stage for the self to evolve. This is also the station of love, and of being in love. We generally find this type of self attractive because it reminds us of a free spirit, as it is less attached and more willing to change course, and is freer of inhibition and attachments. The inspired self is considered easy to treat, for it is not tethered. It has no firm anchorage or rigid boundaries. It is inspired and mobile like quicksilver. One may think of it as mercury - flexible and mobile, but elusive and difficult to steady and grasp. This type of self may begin to be developed and groomed once it has been contained, stabilised and nurtured within a stable base. In this state is the danger of excessive love and wonderment of nature, even worship. This state can be found in scientists, painters, musicians and artists, because of the preponderance of wonderment and marvels that are experienced in their areas. The characteristics of the inspired self are generosity, forgiveness, tolerance, endurance, good opinion, acknolwedging faults, an open-faced smiling countenance, love of peace and meditation, contentment with the decree, and having the ability to weep easily, which is the opposite of the commanding self. Its colour is read, which is lively and vivid and at the centre of the flame. 4 - The Certain Self The fourth station is the certain self ( al-nafs al-mutma'ina ). Here, the self attains confidence and security by knowledge and experience. The self can journey back to its origins, to recall and become inwardly awakened to the reality that everything, including itself, is from reality and to that reality is its return, by the grace and mercy of the same reality. It is that self whose light has been ignited by the spark of the heart, and has overcome the lower characteristics and taken on the higher qualities. It is content, not out of ignorance, but with knowledge. Its contentment is a result of the knowledge that it has done its best within its limits, and therefore all is well. The heart is clear and it is tranquil, content, and steady with faith and trust. Amongst the characteristics of the certain self are unsolicited generosity, dependence on the Creator, freedom from fear of need or attachment, spontaneous awareness of the rule of opposites in the world, sincerity, contentment, freedom in action, contentment with the decree, absence of agitation, gratitude for the perfection of creation and one's place in it, fear and dread of trespassing the bounds (for fear at the beginning of the path is knowledge, fear in the middle is ignorance, fear at the end is delight), being on a clear path, acting only out of certainity, a heart full of trust, faith, certainity, knowledge, right action and security. Its colour is white, reflecting all the colours (and holding or absorbing none). 5 - The Contented Self The fifth station is the contented self ( al-nafs al-radhiya ). It is the station of the one who sees the truth always, in every situation and everything. Its characteristics are sincerity, innocent genuineness, continuing caution and fear of trespassing the bounds, scrupulousness, total inner courtesy, and avoiding any desire except that of knowledge and the pleasure of reality. The contented self is childlike in its simplicity. It is spontaneous, always living in the moment. Its colour is green, the colour of growth and life on earth - the pleasant and \"middle\" colour. 6 - The Self That Everything Is Contented With The sixth station is the self that pleases and satisfies the rest of creation ( al-nafs al-mardhiya ). If one is knowingly content with one's Creator, then everything in creation is content and in harmony with oneself. This is the station where the world of the macrocosm is in equilibrium with the microcosm. This self overflows with mercy and love towards all creation, is devoted to the service of others, and is in complete balance in that interspace between the outer world and the inner reality. This self's responsibilities in the outer world do not veil it from the joy and bliss of inner realities, nor do the inner delights blind it from outer obligations. Here, the self does not know anger, greed, revenge or hatred. Its colour is black, which absorbs all the other colours. All shades and colours stop here. 7 - The Perfected Self The ultimate station is the perfected self ( al-nafs al-kamila ), or the station of pure beingness. Of this station, the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: \"He who knows himself knows his Lord.\" He is the one who knows himself to be an interspace, combined of a physical vehicle (or body), and a spirit of divine origin that rides upon the vehicle as a means of witnessing and arriving back to its blissful abode - the eternal Garden. It also means that he is where the beautiful names of God (the divine attributes of Reality) are gathered and known. The perfected self is in the state of unific knowledge, oneness in divine unity, the state of pure consciousness and pure beingness. The Four Journeys Another model of the journey of the self is given by the great Sufi master, Mulla Sadra. He uses the analogy of the wayfarer to describe any human's journey from the state of ignorant darkness to one of illuminated awareness. In this model he describes the four stages of unveilings along the journey. It begins when a human reaches a point where s/he realises there is no lasting fulfillment in the existential, changing world. We all experience at different times in our life the desire for tranquility and seclusion. When worldly difficulties and failures mount, we may wish to leave it all. Many of us go through a period when the monastic life seems an appropriate refuge and it is during these times that we want to turn our backs on creation. It is often at times of the greatest difficulty and confusion that we turn towards the path of discovery of the source in order to understand the position we have landed in. It is when the actors in the play begin to question the plot that we seek to know the author and ask for an explanation. When we reach this point and realise that there can be no lasting fulfillment in the existential, changing world, we take flight to the edge of the known, which is the unknown dimension. Here the first stage of unveiling begins. The four stages which follow illustrate the main stations that the successful wayfarer attains in his/her journey. Throughout life, s/he will continue to experience the entire spectrum of states to varying degress of intensity. What Mulla Sadra wishes to emphasise here is the established station that the wayfarer attains, rather than simply the passing, temporary state which s/he will continue to experience from time to time in life. The First Journey: From Creation to Creator The first barrier to cross, or the first unveiling, is from the creation to the Creator. The wayfarer flees from the confusing, physical and material universe of opposites to another dimension - the dependable, real and reassuring world of the unified field of reality. The silence within is the knock on the inner door. The unveiling of the first barrier involves tearing away veils both of darkness and light that exist between the seeker and the spiritual reality within. Then the ascent can begin from the station of the lower self to the station of the intellect, and from the station of the intellect to the the station of the spirit, and from the station of the spirit to the farthest goal of supreme splendour. If the wayfarer succeeds in reaching this goal, the final veils are lifted and s/he is annihilated by the death of the transitory, dissolved and submerged in the divine source. The Second Journey: With the Creator by the Courtesy of the Creator The second unveiling is the journey across the barrier to knowledge of the Creator. The wayfarer is now exposed to Reality by the courtesy of Reality. S/he moves totally in the inner realm. S/he attains gnosis. His/her essence, attributes and actions become annihilated in the divine essence. In this journey, s/he sees through His seeing, hears through His hearing and knows through His knowing. When the inner journey and discoveries are taking place, the wayfarer looks for greater confirmation of these openings. S/he is like someone who discovers that s/he is truly a guest, and that the Host is most generous and understanding. The wayfarer then hopes for this condition to last and to remain in this refuge. As though s/he sees his/her image in a mirror for the first time. s/he seeks confirmation and establishment of what s/he has seen. The Third Journey: From the Creator to Creation by the Permission of the Creator The completion of the second unveiling marks the start of the third journey. In this, the wayfarer returns from the Creator back to creation by the permission of the Creator. In this journey, s/he is armed with the knowledge of truth. The wayfarer's state of self-annihilation is complete and s/he now attaines full sobriety and balance. S/he subsists through the subsistence of the Creator. S/he returns to creation by the authority of the Creator with the knowledge of the unveiling. The nature of life does not change and it carries on with its ups and downs. There is no avoidance by anyone of experiencing these outer waves which occur at the surface above the still depths of the ocean. So when the wayfarer is established in his station, s/he returns to creation with all its turmoil. However, the wayfarer, because of his/her knowledge of the nature of the ocean, is now far more able to deal with its changing surface. The waves are of little signficance and the storms are relative puffs of wind compared to the stable mass of the deep. The Fourth Journey: With Creation by the Authority of the Creator The wayfarer then embarks upon the fourth stage, which is to be among creation by the autority of the Creator, when nothing else remains but service in the bliss of knowledge. the seeker observes and recognises creation and humanity, their behaviour and needs. S/he knows the good that they bring about and the evil that they cause, and what causes them happiness and what brings misery. In all this, s/he is with the truth, for his/her entire being has been submerged in reality, and the service rendered by him/her to other beings does not distract from the inner divine bliss, steadfastness and certainty. The fully realised being is now in the ultimate unitive state. S/he is completely in outer service of humanity and in inner abandonment, freedom and joy. When reality in all its various aspects is unveiled to the wayfarer and s/he is established in the knowledge of truth within, a new outlook towards creation emerges. The awakened being sees the divine thread through all existence and therefore is qualified to serve with selflessness, with no danger to creation or to themself. When the individual self has aligned itself with original unified reality, the flowering of the spiritual being has occurred. It is this unveiling that is referred to as \"with creation by the authority of the Creator.\" Wherever the enlightened being looks, he sees the trace and the mark of the Creator. S/he is now an agent of transformation, a loyal slave to the Divine Master and a freed being with no choice but to reflect what comes to his/her pure heart. This is the state of a prophet with the people - outwardly the same as any of them, inwardly turned to the eternal origin.","title":"Maps & Models of the Self"},{"location":"prescriptions/7-stations-4-journeys/#maps-models-of-the-self-and-its-journeys","text":"Note 1 : The map is not the territory, and these overviews are provided for committed seekers who have already walked at least some way along the path.

The stages within a given model naturally overlap, and the entire spectrum within the model remains active to varying degrees of intensity within the human throughout one's life. In the first model, for example, the saint is not exempt from recognising a glimpse of the commanding self within. The self is like the layers of an onion. We remove one layer, and then another, and so on for our whole life. With each removal, the next layer becomes slightly easier to peel away. The outer layers are the hard ones. The more we unpeel, i.e. the more we undress ourselves of our own superimposed layers of personality, the freer and happier we become and the greater the chance of real fulfillment. Ultimately, when we reach a high state of inner awareness and when we have been truly and totally immersed in that state, that inner equilibrium, we have little or no clutter left in us and that is like reaching the last, inner layer of the onion. If we now take off that layer, what is there? Space!","title":"The Seven Kinds of Self"},{"location":"prescriptions/7-stations-4-journeys/#1-the-commanding-self","text":"The first and lowest station is that of the commanding self ( al-nafs al-ammara ). This is the station of one who is not sufficiently developed inwardly, who is crude and childish, base, egoistic and selfish, with little concern or connection with other than self-gratification. This is the self that is dominated by the physical body, and follows mainly the gratification of sensual pleasure and fleeting desires. This state draws the heart towards its lower and negative extreme. This facet of the self is the abode of most vices and the source of all bad characters. The characteristics of the commanding self encompass meanness, greed, envy, jealousy, ignorance, self-importance, pride, glory, presumption, arrogance, sensuality, anger, violence, insensitivity, lack of insight, and vile manners, interference in what does not concern one, making fun and mocking others, avarice, hatred, qualities of rigidity and dogma, opacity, and the inability to be reached or to form stable relationships. The colour related to the commanding self is blue. It is the blue of intense heat in the middle of the flame.","title":"1 - The Commanding Self"},{"location":"prescriptions/7-stations-4-journeys/#2-the-reproachful-self","text":"The second station is the reproachful self ( al-nafs al-lawwama ). In this station, the self develops some sense of right and wrong. It begins to have glimpses into its own conduct and occasionally even blames itself for wrong behaviour. The reproachful self does have some measure of awareness and discrimination, but that reproach usually occurs after the event. It is like a crack, so to speak, in the solid frame of the commanding self, that gives rise to the reproachful self with a slight degree of flexibility and awareness. Its characteristics are acting upon whims of the moment, conceit, having to do with self-image, vanity, injustice, bias, backbiting, slander, lying, and excessive love of leadership. Its colour is yellow. This colour is located on the edge of the flame and represents descending and decaying energy.","title":"2 - The Reproachful Self"},{"location":"prescriptions/7-stations-4-journeys/#3-the-inspired-self","text":"The third station is the inspired self ( al-nafs al-mulhamma ). This condition of the self is supple and dynamic, and therefore leads to vulnerability. It is an interspace between good and bad. The keeping of good company and right guidance is necessary at this stage for the self to evolve. This is also the station of love, and of being in love. We generally find this type of self attractive because it reminds us of a free spirit, as it is less attached and more willing to change course, and is freer of inhibition and attachments. The inspired self is considered easy to treat, for it is not tethered. It has no firm anchorage or rigid boundaries. It is inspired and mobile like quicksilver. One may think of it as mercury - flexible and mobile, but elusive and difficult to steady and grasp. This type of self may begin to be developed and groomed once it has been contained, stabilised and nurtured within a stable base. In this state is the danger of excessive love and wonderment of nature, even worship. This state can be found in scientists, painters, musicians and artists, because of the preponderance of wonderment and marvels that are experienced in their areas. The characteristics of the inspired self are generosity, forgiveness, tolerance, endurance, good opinion, acknolwedging faults, an open-faced smiling countenance, love of peace and meditation, contentment with the decree, and having the ability to weep easily, which is the opposite of the commanding self. Its colour is read, which is lively and vivid and at the centre of the flame.","title":"3 - The Inspired Self"},{"location":"prescriptions/7-stations-4-journeys/#4-the-certain-self","text":"The fourth station is the certain self ( al-nafs al-mutma'ina ). Here, the self attains confidence and security by knowledge and experience. The self can journey back to its origins, to recall and become inwardly awakened to the reality that everything, including itself, is from reality and to that reality is its return, by the grace and mercy of the same reality. It is that self whose light has been ignited by the spark of the heart, and has overcome the lower characteristics and taken on the higher qualities. It is content, not out of ignorance, but with knowledge. Its contentment is a result of the knowledge that it has done its best within its limits, and therefore all is well. The heart is clear and it is tranquil, content, and steady with faith and trust. Amongst the characteristics of the certain self are unsolicited generosity, dependence on the Creator, freedom from fear of need or attachment, spontaneous awareness of the rule of opposites in the world, sincerity, contentment, freedom in action, contentment with the decree, absence of agitation, gratitude for the perfection of creation and one's place in it, fear and dread of trespassing the bounds (for fear at the beginning of the path is knowledge, fear in the middle is ignorance, fear at the end is delight), being on a clear path, acting only out of certainity, a heart full of trust, faith, certainity, knowledge, right action and security.

Pilgrimage consists of both obligatory actions and voluntary actions. The Obligatory Actions are of two types: absolute and restricted (to certain circumstances. The absolute is that the pilgrimage should be the Pilgrimage of Islam, which is fulfilled when the following conditions are met: Maturity Sound mind Freedom Health Easy availability of provisions and means of transport Sufficient funds and the existence of a means of obtaining one\u2019s livelihood The emptying of the innermost distractions (great fears, attachments etc.) The possibility of making the journey. Other basic conditions for Hajj are Islam, maturity of mind, and the power of reasoning. If these requirements are met then one must perform the pilgrimage once within one\u2019s lifetime. With regards to obligations that are restricted in their scope, they are obligatory only if there is a cause which makes them binding (i.e. oaths or contracts). There are three types of Pilgrimage: tamattu` , qaran and ifrad . The tamattu` pilgrimage is obligatory for whomever does not have his family living in the vicinity of the Ka`bah. The qaran and the ifrad are obligatory upon those who have come to the Ka`bah from a distance of 12 miles (or more) in any direction from the House of Allah. The actions of pilgrimage are of two types: obligatory and non\u2011obligatory (preferred voluntary actions). Furthermore the obligatory actions are also of two types: rukn , an action which if omitted nullifies the pilgrimage, and non\u2011rukn , obligatory actions which, if mistakenly omitted, will not nullify the entire pilgrimage. Important Pillars Of the three types of pilgrimage mentioned above, the pillars of the tamattu` pilgrimage are eight in number; four of them are restricted to the `umrah and four to the pilgrimage. The pillars of the `umrah are: Intention ( niyyah ). Assuming the state of ihr\u0101m, including donning the garment at the \"Station for Commencing the Pilgrimage\" ( miq\u0101t ) at the proper time. The taw\u0101f of the `umrah . The Hastening ( sa`y ) between Safa and Marwa. Those which are relevant to Hajj are: The Intention for the Pilgrimage. The Pause at `Arafat. The Pause at Muzdalifah. The Hastening of the Pilgrimage. There are eight actions which are obligatory but not considered to be Pillars: The uttering of the four phrases of Labayk (if one is able to; if not, whatever is said in its place); the two rak`\u0101t of the Taw\u0101f of the `umrah ; the joined prayers after the Hastening; the uttering of the words \"Labayk\" at the time of assuming the state of ihr\u0101m for the pilgrimage (or whatever is done in its place); the sacrifice or that which takes its place in the way of fasting if one is unable to perform it; the two rak`\u0101t of the Taw\u0101f of the pilgrimage; and the taw\u0101f al\u2011nis\u0101\u2019 and its two rak`\u0101t . The Pillars of the qaran and the ifrad are five in number: The Ihr\u0101m The Pause at `Arafat. The Pause at Muzdalifah. The Circumambulation of the Ziy\u0101rah. The Hastening. The actions which are considered to be non-rukn are four in number: The uttering of the words \"Labayka\" or what is done in its place. The two rak`\u0101t of the Taw\u0101f of the Ziy\u0101rah. The taw\u0101f al\u2011nis\u0101\u2019 . The two rak`\u0101t of the taw\u0101f\u2011al\u2011nis\u0101\u2019 . The qaran is distinguished from the ifrad by the performance of the sacrifice. It is preferable ( mustahabb ) to utter the \"Labayka\" at the beginning of each circumambulation for both of them. There are many actions that are considered to be voluntary, preferable actions. One should refer to the books which specifically deal with the pilgrimage for details concerning them. This, then, is the pilgrimage of the people of shari`ah according to the way of the House of the Prophet. The Pilgrimage of the Adepts At the next level the advanced pilgrim will visit the House of Allah \u2013 the Spiritual Ka`bah. This sacred House can be considered from two viewpoints: from that of the \u2018Horizons\u2019 (i.e. the macrocosm) and from that of the self (i.e. the microcosm). With regard to the \u2018Horizons\u2019, this refers to the original human ( ins\u0101n ) heart, also called the \u2018Universal Self\u2019, \"the Visited House\" (Qur'an, 52:4) and the \"Preserved Tablet\" (Qur'an, 85:22\". The \u2018self\u2019 as used here refers to the heart of lesser man which is referred to as the \"heart, the breast, or the articulating self.\" The former of these two, that is, the \u2018Horizons\u2019, are the Qiblah of the people of haqiqah and the latter is the Qiblah of the people of tariqah . The way the people of tariqah go to and turn towards their Qiblah rests upon what has come to us in the tradition that the first House which extended over the water and appeared upon the face of the water was the Ka`bah. This was before the existence of the earth and whatever was made upon it, according to the Prophet\u2019s words: \"The Ka`bah was the first House which appeared upon the face of the water at the time of the creation of the Heavens. He created it \u2026 before the creation of the earth.\" Allah said: \"Surely the first House which was established for the people was the one in Bakkah (Makkah), as a blessing and as a guidance for the worlds. In it are clear signs, the station of Abraham, and whoever enters it is secure, and Allah has obliged the people to make the pilgrimage to the House for whoever can make his way to it, and as for him who defies the commandment, Allah is independent from all of the worlds.\" Qur'an, 3:96\u201197 The tradition and the verse demonstrate that there is both a physical Ka`bah and a spiritual Ka`bah and each of them has two aspects. One of its aspects is the physical masjid which is called al\u2011Masjid ul\u2011Har\u0101m (The Sacred Mosque). The other division is the physical heart, which is also called al\u2011Masjid ul\u2011Har\u0101m . Another aspect is the Greater Heart of Man, which is referred to as the \u2018Universal Soul\u2019, and the other division is the Lesser Heart of Man, which is referred to as the \u2018Differentiated Articulating Self\u2019. The first Reality which manifested within the spiritual realm from the Greater Soul was the Soul of Man, of which it is said that the first thing that Allah created was the soul or reasoning, and it was the Qiblah of haqiqah which was called the Universal Soul; as Allah has said: \"O people fear your Lord Who created you from one soul.\" Qur'an, 4:1 Similarly, the first form which manifested within the physical realm, which is referred to as the \u2018earth\u2019, was the form of the physical Ka`bah; as Allah has said: \"Surely the first House established for the people was the one in Bakkah (Makkah), as a blessing and a guidance for the worlds\u2026\" Qur'an, 3:96 The first Reality which manifested within the spiritual realm from the Lesser Soul of Man, referred to in His words: \"\u2026and when I formed it and blew into it by way of My Soul,\" Qur'an, 15:29 was the Qiblah of haqiqah , which is referred to in the words of the hadith qudsi : \"My earth and My heavens cannot contain Me, but the heart of My slave who has faith contains Me.\" The first form which manifested within the physical realm, that is the \u2018body\u2019, was the form of the physical heart, referred to as the \u2018breast\u2019, of which Allah has said: \"Have We not expanded your breast?\" Qur'an, 94:1 Thus, just as the spiritual Ka`bah may be understood from the physical Ka`bah, the existence of the spiritual heart, which is the lesser Heart of Man, may be understood from the existence of the physical heart, by virtue of: \"We shall show them Our signs on the horizons and in their souls so that the Truth will become clear to them.\" Qur'an, 41:53 It may also be understood from the verse: \"It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and His Throne was upon the water.\" Qur'an, 11:7 The Throne (the structural blueprint) existed before the creation of the physical heavens and earth and is built upon the foundation of the spiritual essences consisting of reasoning and souls. \u2018Throne\u2019 here means the spiritual throne which is the Primal Reasoning. If the meaning of the word \u2018Throne\u2019 refers to the physical Throne, which is the greater cycle of the heavens, then the meaning of the term \u2018water\u2019 signifies physical water. It has also been said that the term \u2018water\u2019 here signifies divine knowledge which is the foundation of all phenomena. Distinguishing it by placing the Throne over it is to signify its vastness and greatness. If we suppose the water upon which the Throne rests is a drop from the Greater Man (the Macrocosm), from the standpoint of form as it is determined to be among the Men of Allah, then the water represents physical water and its manifestation signifies its relationship to the drop from which all forms in the world spring. It is also thus with regard to the Lesser Soul of Man (i.e. the microcosm) which is derived from a drop of sperm. The microcosm is identical to the Macrocosm in all aspects of meaning. The Pilgrimage of the Gnostic This consists of spiritually turning in the direction of the greater Heart of Man, which is the Supreme House of Allah and which is referred to as the \u2018Visited House\u2019, the \u2018Sacred Presence\u2019 and the \u2018Universal Soul\u2019. This is in contrast to the Pilgrimage of the people of tariqah which is directed to the Lesser Heart of Humankind. The authority over the differential (individual) soul, which is the soul of the Lesser Man, cannot exist anywhere but within the mind. Likewise the authority over the Universal Soul which is the soul of the Greater Man, and which is referred to as the universe, cannot exist anywhere but within the Throne (similar, in this instance, to the mind). Furthermore, in the same way that it initially manifests within the Lesser Man as the physical heart, which is the fountainhead of life, so too it is that its initial manifestation within the Greater Man is the Fourth Celestial Sphere, which is the celestial sphere of the sun, the fountainhead of life in the world. Thus it is like the breast of the Greater Man with the sun being like the physical heart within it. The heart of haqiqah is the Universal Soul, which is also called the \u2018Preserved Tablet\u2019, the \u2018Clear Book\u2019 and \u2018Adam of the Haqiqah\u2019. Allah alludes to it in the verse: \"O people, fear your Lord Who created you from One Soul and He created its mate from it.\" Qur'an, 4:1 The Soul of the Fourth Celestial Sphere is like the animal soul which is in the heart. All parts of the body receive life from it. It is the well-known \u2018Visited House\u2019 of the shari`ah , the Fourth Heaven, and it is by it that Allah makes an oath in the verse: \"By the Mountain and inscribed Book on a fine outstretched parchment and the Visited House and elevated canopy and the overflowing sea.\" Qur'an, 52:1\u20116 The \u2018mountain\u2019 represents the Throne, and the \u2018inscribed Book\u2019 represents the Universal Soul which is the heart of the universe. The \u2018fine outstretched parchment\u2019 represents the Eighth Celestial Sphere, which is its manifestation. The \u2018elevated canopy\u2019 may be the Throne or it may represent the earthly sky. The \u2018Visited House\u2019 may represent the Fourth Celestial Sphere and it may represent the Universal Soul. The \u2018overflowing sea\u2019 is filled with forms and may represent the Realm of the Barrier, or interspace or barrier ( barzakh ), which lies between the two worlds of the spiritual and physical, and is referred to as the shadow realm and is filled with the form of everything in creation. The Ka`bah represents the Universal Soul which is called the Supreme House of Allah; its appearance on the water is an allusion to the spiritual realms which originate from it before the physical realms. \"It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and His Throne was upon the water.\" Qur'an, 11:7 This could mean that before the creation of the physical heavens and earth the Throne was upon their two spiritual counterparts, reasoning and the self, if by the term \u2018Throne\u2019 we mean the spiritual Throne which is the Primal Reasoning. It is possible that the water is an allusion to the basic matter from which the universe was created. Furthermore, it is possible that this was before \u2018the splitting asunder\u2019 during the time of unity when all primordial matter was in one state, when reasoning, the soul, and the Throne were one Reality. The \u2018First House\u2019 which has been alluded to is the Universal Soul and the word \u2018Bakkah\u2019, is an allusion to the Eighth Celestial Sphere, which is termed the Dais (kursiy) and as \u2018Blessed\u2019 \u2013 an allusion to the blessing of knowledge and truth which surround it and which descend from it to the rest of creation below it. \u2018A guidance for the world\u2019 is an allusion to its overflowing grace and illumination for all of the worlds. \u2018The station of Abraham\u2019 is an allusion to the arrival of the spiritual traveler, by means of it, to the station of the all\u2011inclusive oneness of the haqiqah of Abraham. Allah says the following concerning this: \"And in this way We show Abraham the dominion of the heavens and the earth so that he may be among the certain.\" Qur'an, 6:75 \"\u2026and whoever has entered it is secure.\" Qur'an, 3:97 These words indicate that whoever enters the House in the manner mentioned above will be secure from all suspicion and doubt regarding the cosmic Divine sanctity. He will be secure from the two forms of associating others with Allah, i.e. openly and secretly. \"\u2026And Allah has obliged the people to make the Pilgrimage to the House\u2026\" Qur'an, 3:97 That is to say, from the standpoint of spiritual knowledge, of witnessing, unveiling, and viewing an obligation rests upon the people who are ready for this station to go to that House in this manner. The verse \"\u2026whoever is able to make his way to it,\" Qur'an, 3:97 is an indication of His having distinguished a particular group of people who are able to do it by virtue of their appropriate knowledge and good action. Useful knowledge is attained in two ways. Either directly from Allah without any human intermediary, referred to as revelation, inspiration and unveiling, or through the medium of the men of knowledge, like His Prophets and Messengers. They are alluded to in: \"Read: And your Lord is the Most Generous, He who taught with the pen,\" Qur'an, 96:3\u20114 and: \"\u2026and when Allah made a covenant with those who were given the Book: You shall certainly make it known to men and you shall not hide it. And they cast it behind their backs and took a small price for it; so wretched is that which they have purchased.\" Qur'an, 3:187 Good actions also have two aspects: One relates to the people of shari`ah and tariqah, and refers to good and purifying actions, with no trace of doubt or suspicion and which is performed purely and sincerely for Allah. The other aspect is distinctly for the people of haqiqah and the people of attainment, and this is not known or witnessed by anyone in existence except by Allah: \"So whoever wants to meet his Lord, let him perform a good action and not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord.\" Qur'an, 18:110 Stations of the Self Thus, whoever desires to go on the Pilgrimage of the gnostics must assume the state of ihr\u0101m from witnessing the realms of the senses completely, by forbidding (i.e. making har\u0101m) his self from witnessing the physical universe and those worldly pleasures which are connected with it. Then he should direct his attention to the spiritual realm, which is the Sanctuary, Makkah or Bakkah, so that in fact he may attain it and become adorned with the Attributes of this spiritual realm and obtain its knowledge. Then he should direct his attention to the Ka`bah of Haqiqah, which is the Universal Soul and its knowledge and truths, and make seven taw\u0101fs around it. The seven stations of the self are: The Commanding Self ( nafs al\u2011amm\u0101rah ) The Critical Self ( nafs al\u2011laww\u0101mah ) The Inspirational Self ( nafs al\u2011mulhamah ) The Tranquil Self ( nafs al\u2011mutma\u2019innah ) The Contented Self ( nafs al\u2011radiyah ) The Self which is the object of Allah\u2019s contentment ( nafs al\u2011mardiyah ) The Perfected Self ( nafs al\u2011k\u0101milah ) The levels of knowledge of the physical realm correspond to what has been called the \u2018Seven Levels of Qur\u2019anic Knowledge\u2019, of which there are numerous subdivisions, and have been indicated by the Prophet when he said: \"Indeed the Qur\u2019an possesses both an outward and an inward and its inward possesses an inward continuing to seven levels.\" Then the attention is turned to the station of Abraham, which is the station of Unity, and the Presence of Oneness, known as the Primal Reasoning and the Supreme Soul. There he performs a prayer of two rak`\u0101t in thanksgiving for having arrived at that Presence. The two rak`\u0101t represent the annihilation from both the outer and the inner realms and whatever they contain of existence and creation, including himself. Then he hastens between Safa and Marwa (outer and inner worlds), to observe them once again with his effort and struggle in order to discontinue looking upon multiplicity by carefully examining the One Existence which lies behind it, and to become firmly established in the station of unity or gatheredness, which is his desired destination. Then he directs his attention to the Ka`bah once again in order to witness the Universal Soul and to observe its truths. He takes the ihr\u0101m of the Pilgrimage from it, which is beyond rationality, in the prescribed manner. Then he turns his attention to `Arafat (the station of the self). Turning one\u2019s attention to the `Arafat of the self is to turn the attention to the station of knowledge of haqiqah and there is no Presence after this Presence except the presence of the Essence, which no one can reach, for it has preceded and reached all before creation. In this station the arrival at the Unity of true gatheredness is attained, which is referred to as \u2018Muhammadi Unity\u2019. It is here that a man becomes a human ( ins\u0101n ) where the perfected being is perfected, and where the Master becomes a Master. For this reason they are obliged to return to the task of bringing others to perfection by returning to the realm of multiplicity, as Allah has said: \"\u2026and to warn their people when they return to them.\" Qur'an 9:122 When Shaykh Junayd was asked about the end destination, he replied: \"(It is) the return to the starting point.\" This is the secret of the return of the pilgrim from `Arafat to Mina, because it symbolizes the return to the realm of multiplicity. Then he occupies himself with the performance of the rituals of Mina, that is, the business of the outward world viz. the stoning, the sacrifice and the shaving of the head. He casts the stone of `Aqabah, which represents the world and its provision, casting it away without the possibility of returning, now that he lives the life of haqiqah (the real life): \"Do not reckon that those who have been killed in the way of Allah are dead; on the contrary, they are alive sustained with their Lord.\" Qur'an, 3:169 And: \"\u2026or is the one who has been dead and to whom We have restored life and made a light for him with which he walks among the people like the one who is within darkness from which he does not escape?\" Qur'an, 6:122 He then shaves his head, that is, he cuts the head of his self from the love of the world and its provision, thereby symbolizing that he will never allow his self to return again. Then he returns to the station of eternity, which is the ongoingness after annihilation, and he goes around the Ka`bah again in order to examine it once more from seven aspects in accordance with the state of his own creation, which is in seven stages; as Allah has said: \"\u2026He created you in stages\" Qur'an, 71:14 so that he may glimpse or experience the light of truth by way of that free movement within the seven regions of the earth and the seven celestial regions, which are referred to as Spiritual Regions and the Realm of Power respectively. Then he performs sal\u0101t at the station of Abraham, the Unity of Haqiqah, performing the two rak`\u0101t prayer of the Feast (Feast of the Sacrifice and Feast of the Fast Breaking), because of having become annihilated from every feast and because of his remaining eternally in a constant state of feasting in divine light, in the station of the Unity of Haqiqah. Finally he returns to Mina, to the world of multiplicity and the three stages which are mineral, plant and animal and stays there for three days of the Days of Allah, as Allah says: \"\u2026today I have completed for you your way of life (Islam) and I have perfected My Grace upon you and I am contented with Islam as a way of life for you.\" Qur'an, 5:3","title":"Pilgrimage"},{"location":"prescriptions/pilgrimage/#the-different-kinds-of-pilgrimage","text":"Many of the key words used in this article are explained in full detail in this section of our glossary","title":"The Different Kinds of Pilgrimage"},{"location":"prescriptions/pilgrimage/#the-pilgrimage-of-revealed-law","text":"The pilgrimage at this first level is to go to the Ka`bah, or Sacred House of Allah, to carry out the prescribed rituals which are to be performed at specific times. Pilgrimage consists of both obligatory actions and voluntary actions. The Obligatory Actions are of two types: absolute and restricted (to certain circumstances. The absolute is that the pilgrimage should be the Pilgrimage of Islam, which is fulfilled when the following conditions are met: Maturity Sound mind Freedom Health Easy availability of provisions and means of transport Sufficient funds and the existence of a means of obtaining one\u2019s livelihood The emptying of the innermost distractions (great fears, attachments etc.) The possibility of making the journey. Other basic conditions for Hajj are Islam, maturity of mind, and the power of reasoning. If these requirements are met then one must perform the pilgrimage once within one\u2019s lifetime. With regards to obligations that are restricted in their scope, they are obligatory only if there is a cause which makes them binding (i.e. oaths or contracts). There are three types of Pilgrimage: tamattu` , qaran and ifrad . The tamattu` pilgrimage is obligatory for whomever does not have his family living in the vicinity of the Ka`bah. The qaran and the ifrad are obligatory upon those who have come to the Ka`bah from a distance of 12 miles (or more) in any direction from the House of Allah. The actions of pilgrimage are of two types: obligatory and non\u2011obligatory (preferred voluntary actions). Furthermore the obligatory actions are also of two types: rukn , an action which if omitted nullifies the pilgrimage, and non\u2011rukn , obligatory actions which, if mistakenly omitted, will not nullify the entire pilgrimage.","title":"The Pilgrimage of Revealed Law"},{"location":"prescriptions/pilgrimage/#important-pillars","text":"Of the three types of pilgrimage mentioned above, the pillars of the tamattu` pilgrimage are eight in number; four of them are restricted to the `umrah and four to the pilgrimage. The pillars of the `umrah are: Intention ( niyyah ). Assuming the state of ihr\u0101m, including donning the garment at the \"Station for Commencing the Pilgrimage\" ( miq\u0101t ) at the proper time. The taw\u0101f of the `umrah . The Hastening ( sa`y ) between Safa and Marwa. Those which are relevant to Hajj are: The Intention for the Pilgrimage. The Pause at `Arafat. The Pause at Muzdalifah. The Hastening of the Pilgrimage. There are eight actions which are obligatory but not considered to be Pillars: The uttering of the four phrases of Labayk (if one is able to; if not, whatever is said in its place); the two rak`\u0101t of the Taw\u0101f of the `umrah ; the joined prayers after the Hastening; the uttering of the words \"Labayk\" at the time of assuming the state of ihr\u0101m for the pilgrimage (or whatever is done in its place); the sacrifice or that which takes its place in the way of fasting if one is unable to perform it; the two rak`\u0101t of the Taw\u0101f of the pilgrimage; and the taw\u0101f al\u2011nis\u0101\u2019 and its two rak`\u0101t .

It is preferable ( mustahabb ) to utter the \"Labayka\" at the beginning of each circumambulation for both of them. There are many actions that are considered to be voluntary, preferable actions. One should refer to the books which specifically deal with the pilgrimage for details concerning them. This, then, is the pilgrimage of the people of shari`ah according to the way of the House of the Prophet.","title":"Important Pillars"},{"location":"prescriptions/pilgrimage/#the-pilgrimage-of-the-adepts","text":"At the next level the advanced pilgrim will visit the House of Allah \u2013 the Spiritual Ka`bah. This sacred House can be considered from two viewpoints: from that of the \u2018Horizons\u2019 (i.e. the macrocosm) and from that of the self (i.e. the microcosm). With regard to the \u2018Horizons\u2019, this refers to the original human ( ins\u0101n ) heart, also called the \u2018Universal Self\u2019, \"the Visited House\" (Qur'an, 52:4) and the \"Preserved Tablet\" (Qur'an, 85:22\". The \u2018self\u2019 as used here refers to the heart of lesser man which is referred to as the \"heart, the breast, or the articulating self.\" The former of these two, that is, the \u2018Horizons\u2019, are the Qiblah of the people of haqiqah and the latter is the Qiblah of the people of tariqah . The way the people of tariqah go to and turn towards their Qiblah rests upon what has come to us in the tradition that the first House which extended over the water and appeared upon the face of the water was the Ka`bah. This was before the existence of the earth and whatever was made upon it, according to the Prophet\u2019s words: \"The Ka`bah was the first House which appeared upon the face of the water at the time of the creation of the Heavens. He created it \u2026 before the creation of the earth.\" Allah said: \"Surely the first House which was established for the people was the one in Bakkah (Makkah), as a blessing and as a guidance for the worlds. In it are clear signs, the station of Abraham, and whoever enters it is secure, and Allah has obliged the people to make the pilgrimage to the House for whoever can make his way to it, and as for him who defies the commandment, Allah is independent from all of the worlds.\" Qur'an, 3:96\u201197 The tradition and the verse demonstrate that there is both a physical Ka`bah and a spiritual Ka`bah and each of them has two aspects. One of its aspects is the physical masjid which is called al\u2011Masjid ul\u2011Har\u0101m (The Sacred Mosque). The other division is the physical heart, which is also called al\u2011Masjid ul\u2011Har\u0101m . Another aspect is the Greater Heart of Man, which is referred to as the \u2018Universal Soul\u2019, and the other division is the Lesser Heart of Man, which is referred to as the \u2018Differentiated Articulating Self\u2019. The first Reality which manifested within the spiritual realm from the Greater Soul was the Soul of Man, of which it is said that the first thing that Allah created was the soul or reasoning, and it was the Qiblah of haqiqah which was called the Universal Soul; as Allah has said: \"O people fear your Lord Who created you from one soul.\" Qur'an, 4:1 Similarly, the first form which manifested within the physical realm, which is referred to as the \u2018earth\u2019, was the form of the physical Ka`bah; as Allah has said: \"Surely the first House established for the people was the one in Bakkah (Makkah), as a blessing and a guidance for the worlds\u2026\" Qur'an, 3:96 The first Reality which manifested within the spiritual realm from the Lesser Soul of Man, referred to in His words: \"\u2026and when I formed it and blew into it by way of My Soul,\" Qur'an, 15:29 was the Qiblah of haqiqah , which is referred to in the words of the hadith qudsi : \"My earth and My heavens cannot contain Me, but the heart of My slave who has faith contains Me.\" The first form which manifested within the physical realm, that is the \u2018body\u2019, was the form of the physical heart, referred to as the \u2018breast\u2019, of which Allah has said: \"Have We not expanded your breast?\" Qur'an, 94:1 Thus, just as the spiritual Ka`bah may be understood from the physical Ka`bah, the existence of the spiritual heart, which is the lesser Heart of Man, may be understood from the existence of the physical heart, by virtue of: \"We shall show them Our signs on the horizons and in their souls so that the Truth will become clear to them.\" Qur'an, 41:53 It may also be understood from the verse: \"It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and His Throne was upon the water.\" Qur'an, 11:7 The Throne (the structural blueprint) existed before the creation of the physical heavens and earth and is built upon the foundation of the spiritual essences consisting of reasoning and souls. \u2018Throne\u2019 here means the spiritual throne which is the Primal Reasoning. If the meaning of the word \u2018Throne\u2019 refers to the physical Throne, which is the greater cycle of the heavens, then the meaning of the term \u2018water\u2019 signifies physical water.

It is possible that the water is an allusion to the basic matter from which the universe was created. Furthermore, it is possible that this was before \u2018the splitting asunder\u2019 during the time of unity when all primordial matter was in one state, when reasoning, the soul, and the Throne were one Reality.

Allah says the following concerning this: \"And in this way We show Abraham the dominion of the heavens and the earth so that he may be among the certain.\" Qur'an, 6:75 \"\u2026and whoever has entered it is secure.\" Qur'an, 3:97 These words indicate that whoever enters the House in the manner mentioned above will be secure from all suspicion and doubt regarding the cosmic Divine sanctity. He will be secure from the two forms of associating others with Allah, i.e. openly and secretly. \"\u2026And Allah has obliged the people to make the Pilgrimage to the House\u2026\" Qur'an, 3:97 That is to say, from the standpoint of spiritual knowledge, of witnessing, unveiling, and viewing an obligation rests upon the people who are ready for this station to go to that House in this manner. The verse \"\u2026whoever is able to make his way to it,\" Qur'an, 3:97 is an indication of His having distinguished a particular group of people who are able to do it by virtue of their appropriate knowledge and good action.

The other aspect is distinctly for the people of haqiqah and the people of attainment, and this is not known or witnessed by anyone in existence except by Allah: \"So whoever wants to meet his Lord, let him perform a good action and not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord.\" Qur'an, 18:110","title":"The Pilgrimage of the Gnostic"},{"location":"prescriptions/pilgrimage/#stations-of-the-self","text":"Thus, whoever desires to go on the Pilgrimage of the gnostics must assume the state of ihr\u0101m from witnessing the realms of the senses completely, by forbidding (i.e. making har\u0101m) his self from witnessing the physical universe and those worldly pleasures which are connected with it. Then he should direct his attention to the spiritual realm, which is the Sanctuary, Makkah or Bakkah, so that in fact he may attain it and become adorned with the Attributes of this spiritual realm and obtain its knowledge. Then he should direct his attention to the Ka`bah of Haqiqah, which is the Universal Soul and its knowledge and truths, and make seven taw\u0101fs around it. The seven stations of the self are: The Commanding Self ( nafs al\u2011amm\u0101rah ) The Critical Self ( nafs al\u2011laww\u0101mah ) The Inspirational Self ( nafs al\u2011mulhamah ) The Tranquil Self ( nafs al\u2011mutma\u2019innah ) The Contented Self ( nafs al\u2011radiyah ) The Self which is the object of Allah\u2019s contentment ( nafs al\u2011mardiyah ) The Perfected Self ( nafs al\u2011k\u0101milah ) The levels of knowledge of the physical realm correspond to what has been called the \u2018Seven Levels of Qur\u2019anic Knowledge\u2019, of which there are numerous subdivisions, and have been indicated by the Prophet when he said: \"Indeed the Qur\u2019an possesses both an outward and an inward and its inward possesses an inward continuing to seven levels.\" Then the attention is turned to the station of Abraham, which is the station of Unity, and the Presence of Oneness, known as the Primal Reasoning and the Supreme Soul. There he performs a prayer of two rak`\u0101t in thanksgiving for having arrived at that Presence. The two rak`\u0101t represent the annihilation from both the outer and the inner realms and whatever they contain of existence and creation, including himself. Then he hastens between Safa and Marwa (outer and inner worlds), to observe them once again with his effort and struggle in order to discontinue looking upon multiplicity by carefully examining the One Existence which lies behind it, and to become firmly established in the station of unity or gatheredness, which is his desired destination. Then he directs his attention to the Ka`bah once again in order to witness the Universal Soul and to observe its truths. He takes the ihr\u0101m of the Pilgrimage from it, which is beyond rationality, in the prescribed manner. Then he turns his attention to `Arafat (the station of the self). Turning one\u2019s attention to the `Arafat of the self is to turn the attention to the station of knowledge of haqiqah and there is no Presence after this Presence except the presence of the Essence, which no one can reach, for it has preceded and reached all before creation. In this station the arrival at the Unity of true gatheredness is attained, which is referred to as \u2018Muhammadi Unity\u2019. It is here that a man becomes a human ( ins\u0101n ) where the perfected being is perfected, and where the Master becomes a Master. For this reason they are obliged to return to the task of bringing others to perfection by returning to the realm of multiplicity, as Allah has said: \"\u2026and to warn their people when they return to them.\" Qur'an 9:122 When Shaykh Junayd was asked about the end destination, he replied: \"(It is) the return to the starting point.\" This is the secret of the return of the pilgrim from `Arafat to Mina, because it symbolizes the return to the realm of multiplicity. Then he occupies himself with the performance of the rituals of Mina, that is, the business of the outward world viz. the stoning, the sacrifice and the shaving of the head. He casts the stone of `Aqabah, which represents the world and its provision, casting it away without the possibility of returning, now that he lives the life of haqiqah (the real life): \"Do not reckon that those who have been killed in the way of Allah are dead; on the contrary, they are alive sustained with their Lord.\" Qur'an, 3:169 And: \"\u2026or is the one who has been dead and to whom We have restored life and made a light for him with which he walks among the people like the one who is within darkness from which he does not escape?\" Qur'an, 6:122 He then shaves his head, that is, he cuts the head of his self from the love of the world and its provision, thereby symbolizing that he will never allow his self to return again. Then he returns to the station of eternity, which is the ongoingness after annihilation, and he goes around the Ka`bah again in order to examine it once more from seven aspects in accordance with the state of his own creation, which is in seven stages; as Allah has said: \"\u2026He created you in stages\" Qur'an, 71:14 so that he may glimpse or experience the light of truth by way of that free movement within the seven regions of the earth and the seven celestial regions, which are referred to as Spiritual Regions and the Realm of Power respectively. Then he performs sal\u0101t at the station of Abraham, the Unity of Haqiqah, performing the two rak`\u0101t prayer of the Feast (Feast of the Sacrifice and Feast of the Fast Breaking), because of having become annihilated from every feast and because of his remaining eternally in a constant state of feasting in divine light, in the station of the Unity of Haqiqah. Finally he returns to Mina, to the world of multiplicity and the three stages which are mineral, plant and animal and stays there for three days of the Days of Allah, as Allah says: \"\u2026today I have completed for you your way of life (Islam) and I have perfected My Grace upon you and I am contented with Islam as a way of life for you.\" Qur'an, 5:3","title":"Stations of the Self"},{"location":"prescriptions/self-knowledge-presence/","text":"Self Knowledge and Unfolding Into Presence The Self This guide is comprised of a series of interlinked extracts from various books written by Shaykh Fadhlalla over the years on the theme of Self Knowledge, Presence, and how to deepen one's practice of both.

Energy and Awareness In any given situation you will have a certain amount of energy . However we like to measure it, you will find a certain amount of energy available at any one time .

Generosity Selflessness We enjoy ease and the smooth flow of life, welcoming generosity at all levels \u2014 material, mental and emotional. A generous act can be transactional or free of the expectation of any return. Even then, there is a subtle transaction \u2014 the giver also receives. All our actions are interactive and the dynamics of energy fields and matter are ceaseless. A generous mind is limited and measured, whereas a generous heart can be unconditional and simply flows. The ego self is the obstacle to such generosity and can darken the heart. Modesty reduces egoistic tendency and selfless acts touch hearts and souls. The human journey is from ego to soul. The ultimate human purpose is to recognize the ego\u2019s limitations and transcend it through generous acts and unconditional love . Passion A spiritual seeker may be initially motivated by the love of paradise and fear of hell fire. The awakened person is no longer concerned about either, due to being absorbed in the love of the ever present perfection. Then comes passion, in which the lover has lost direction and identification, being lost in the Beloved. In the outer world being lost is stupidity and ignorance, whereas in the inner world being lost to the essence is the entry into serendipity and bliss. With the realization of life\u2019s great potential, every moment becomes precious and is given its due respect and importance. To be deliberately enslaved to the supreme cosmic light is to be free from outer shadows. It is by God\u2019s generosity, mercy and grace that we turn away from our egotistical dark shadows towards the luminous light of the soul within the heart. Prophets, messengers and enlightened beings have awakened to these companions and guides along the spiritual path. These revealed knowledges cannot be reached by reason, wisdom or supplication. They need to be imbibed or absorbed through passion. Concern The less the self is concerned with worldly matters, the greater the soul\u2019s receptivity to messages and guidance via the heart. People who excel in the material world are unlikely to be able to give sufficient attention to the exploration of the inner subtler realms. Love, trust and absorption in the outer world may harden the heart and hinder spiritual progress.

Two Zones There are always at least two viewpoints at any time. You can face the past or the future, origin or destination. You observe and hear what is outside of you or reflect upon your inner senses and feelings. You are always held in between these two zones and desire balance and stability. This tension enables us to grow and evolve physically, mentally and spiritually. Everything that exists has an outer and an inner facet, which are in balance. For a youngster, most experiences are due to sensory stimulation. For an adult there is outer and inner consciousness. For an awakened being the outer and inner are seamlessly bound together due to the emergence of the light of the Oneness.

We also too often feel trapped, confused or lost. Why are we constantly faced with these challenges? This is due to the limitations of conditioned consciousness and ego. Between birth and death, we play roles in this shadow theatre of life, as we evolve towards our origin. Frustrations arise out of the disparity between our higher soul consciousness and the shadow self. How can we refer and calibrate our perceived experience with the constancy of the soul? It is helpful to have a role model, and more helpful to have a trusted teacher who reflects higher consciousness. Virtues and Vices and the Importance of Interaction From the book \u201c The Journey of the Self \u2013 A Sufi Guide to Personality \u201d The importance of virtue to self-development can be seen after defining what is meant by virtue. We define virtue as behaviour occurring at the centre of two extremes, both of which are unvirtuous. The virtuous value which is at the centre is not affected by the unvirtuous values around it unless it moves towards one or the other extremes, away from the centre. When it happens, the virtue takes on the colour of that particular vice. For example, the virtue of generosity is the midpoint between two vices \u2013 meanness at one extreme, and indiscriminate giving, or wastefulness, at the other extreme. This characteristic of virtue (lying at the centre between vices), becomes practically useful once understood, practiced and perfected in actual life-transaction situations. Interacting and transaction with the extremes is an essential ingredient in acquiring the knowledge of virtues. Virtues are the outcome of dynamic and active situations involving interaction with other people and beings. In our social exchanges, we will both teach and be taught virtues. Necessarily, we will have to be patient with all the afflictions and setbacks we experience until we perfect our knowledge. Loyalty To be loyal implies total connection understanding and unity \u2013 thus loyalty emanates from the field of Oneness. Can there be loyalty between two changing entities? Can you be loyal to another human being? Change, uncertainty and the fields of duality are barriers to loyalty. Unless there is one constant reference, loyalty cannot be durable! Unless each entity calibrates with its organic source of Oneness there can be no lasting loyalty. True loyalty to another being can emanate from the original loyalty to the One essence from which all dualities have emanated. Loyalty to the One can bring about the experience of being loyal to those seeking the knowledge and experience of the One. It is part of human nature to consider loyalty as a good virtue for it contains within it an aspect of Oneness and unity. The purpose of human life is to be in constant reference to the cosmic Oneness \u2013 Allah and all his attributes. Higher Consciousness The zone of higher consciousness is infinite and beyond all descriptions like joy, bliss or happiness. A good example of how to move to higher consciousness is riding a bicycle. You are put on the saddle and somebody pushes you. After a while you learn to balance and you feel you can repeat it on your own. Similarly, you first need a map of Reality, and you then follow the path that may lead to your destination. Determination and grace are required to awaken to your Soul. It is when you experience that ever-present Reality, you know that your old self was merely a shadow, of the Real. When you transcend your tyrannical or feral self, you perceive that its role was to cause that suffering and thereby act as a prelude for awakening. Your lower self leads you to your real self \u2013 the divine spirit within. Life on earth is a struggle because it is a realm of experience between limitations and limitless Reality. You need help and a guiding hand. You need a reference. You need Grace and perception of the sacred presence. Now Is Eternal Identity relates to mind, memory and time. Thoughts connect the past to the present and future. Reflection, meditation and the silent mind enable us to experience the immense present moment \u2013 now. Much human effort is expended to reduce distance and separation. As for time, we try to go faster than all possibilities or, more effectively, to stop time altogether. Our human conditioned consciousness drives us towards stillness in mind, which opens the door of timelessness and perpetual presence. All human endeavours lead to a point of experience, which occurs when the mind is content and still. The moment of success or heightened pleasure reflects this state. Within the still moment lies the zone of transcendence of mind and time. That is the infinitude of Reality. When the past is lost and the future is of no concern, the perfection of now is a great gift that yields a lasting thrill.","title":"Virtuous Being, Higher Conduct"},{"location":"prescriptions/virtue-higher-conduct/#virtuous-being-and-higher-conduct","text":"We often experience disappointment and frustrations.

Then he must go past the illusion of seeing Attributes other than those of Allah. That is the station of the Unity of Attributes. Finally, he must go past the veil of \u2018independent\u2019 entities or events \u2013 in Truth, there is no Reality except the One Reality, Allah. That is the station of the Unity of Essence, which is the goal of the Path, and indeed, the goal of existence itself. Shaykh Ahmad al\u2011`Alawi said that whoever has arrived at this station cannot see anything other than Allah even if he intends to do so. He also said that when it is established within one\u2019s self that it is an obligation to abstain from anything other than Allah, the self will begin to long for the knowledge of Allah, and this is like what occurs with the rising of the crescent moon of Ramadan: \"Whoever among you witnesses the month, let him fast\u2026\" Qur'an, 2:185 The Station of Witnessing This station is that of witnessing or seeing, first outwardly and then in the subtle spiritual realms, and whoever does not raise his head will not witness the spiritual realms of the heavens and the earth. The determination and concern of the seeker should not be concentrated in the senses as this will cause the heart to turn away from witnessing the Lord. It is for this reason that he abandons everything which reaches him by way of the senses. The seeker will not be able to concentrate his will and direction until he is detached from his senses. The senses may dominate the outward, as one of the Masters has said that the senses will obliterate meaning unless the senses become the essence of meaning themselves. Shaykh al\u2011`Alawi says that the self of the seeker is afflicted by separation which is often expressed as being in a state of jan\u0101bah ; absorption in Allah, then, is forbidden to him and the veil will descend upon him because of the existence of this obstacle. When the barrier is removed, then the seeker is obliged to make up whatever he missed. Allah has warned those who are not patient with \"one food\" (Qur'an, 2:61), that is, with the Unity of Essence, and who long for anything other than that from among the realms of creation, when He said: \"Would you exchange that which is good for that which is low and base? Then go down to a city and your wish will be granted\u2026\" Qur'an, 2:61 The significance of \u2018city\u2019 here is that it represents the consuming self with all that it contains of desires and expectations both open and hidden. This is alluded to in: \"\u2026from whatever the earth causes to grow of greens, cucumbers, garlic, lentils and onions.\" Qur'an, 2:61 Here Allah alludes to the desires of the self which lead to degradation: \"\u2026and they were afflicted with degradation and helplessness and were forced to endure anger from Allah.\" Qur'an, 2:61 This is the state when the lower self is in command and the way out is to take strength by way of the friendship of Allah. For this reason it is said that if you want strength which will not vanish, then do not take pride in strength which will vanish. The Fast of Haqiqah Whoever fasts the fast of haqiqah , and consequently abstains from anything other than Allah, is fasting according to the following hadith qudsi : \"For every good action there is the recompense of ten to seven hundred times its worth except fasting, for, indeed, it is solely for Me and I shall surely be the reward.\" At the earlier phases of spiritual evolvement, the fast is rewarded by the Garden, joy, houris and palaces, or by nearness, attainment, unveiling, and witnessing. At the advanced level the fast has its reward in Allah Himself, the Granter of rewards. The difference between the fast of the people of tariqah and that of the people of haqiqah is that the former is a means for refining the behavior and taking on the Attributes of Allah, as the Prophet said: \"Mould your character with Allah\u2019s Attributes.\" The fast of the people of haqiqah , on the other hand, is a means of attaining annihilation and of cleansing oneself by Allah in the station of Pure Unity, which is referred to as annihilation in Unity; as Allah has said in a hadith qudsi : \"Whoever has sought Me has found Me. Whoever has found Me has come to know Me. Whoever has known Me has loved Me. Whoever has loved Me I have slain. Whomever I have slain the payment of the blood money is on Me, and I will Myself be the payment for the blood money that I owe.\" One relevant example often given is that of a lump of charcoal and fire. Suppose that there is a strong fire which is described in terms of light, burning, and heat, and that next to it lays charcoal which may be described as dark and cold. As this charcoal is gradually moved closer to the fire, we see that it begins to take on the same characteristics as the fire as fire begins to glow from the charcoal itself. Thus, the charcoal becomes fire and no longer remains charcoal. \"These parables We make for the people and they are not understood except by the wise.\" Qur'an, 29:43","title":"The Awakened Seeker"},{"location":"prescriptions/fasting/awakened-seeker/#the-awakend-seeker","text":"The awakened seeker must give up the illusion of seeing actions as coming from other than Allah so that by this realization he may arrive at the station of the Unity of Action.

Shaykh al\u2011`Alawi says that the self of the seeker is afflicted by separation which is often expressed as being in a state of jan\u0101bah ; absorption in Allah, then, is forbidden to him and the veil will descend upon him because of the existence of this obstacle. When the barrier is removed, then the seeker is obliged to make up whatever he missed. Allah has warned those who are not patient with \"one food\" (Qur'an, 2:61), that is, with the Unity of Essence, and who long for anything other than that from among the realms of creation, when He said: \"Would you exchange that which is good for that which is low and base? Then go down to a city and your wish will be granted\u2026\" Qur'an, 2:61 The significance of \u2018city\u2019 here is that it represents the consuming self with all that it contains of desires and expectations both open and hidden. This is alluded to in: \"\u2026from whatever the earth causes to grow of greens, cucumbers, garlic, lentils and onions.\" Qur'an, 2:61 Here Allah alludes to the desires of the self which lead to degradation: \"\u2026and they were afflicted with degradation and helplessness and were forced to endure anger from Allah.\" Qur'an, 2:61 This is the state when the lower self is in command and the way out is to take strength by way of the friendship of Allah. For this reason it is said that if you want strength which will not vanish, then do not take pride in strength which will vanish.","title":"The Station of Witnessing"},{"location":"prescriptions/fasting/awakened-seeker/#the-fast-of-haqiqah","text":"Whoever fasts the fast of haqiqah , and consequently abstains from anything other than Allah, is fasting according to the following hadith qudsi : \"For every good action there is the recompense of ten to seven hundred times its worth except fasting, for, indeed, it is solely for Me and I shall surely be the reward.\" At the earlier phases of spiritual evolvement, the fast is rewarded by the Garden, joy, houris and palaces, or by nearness, attainment, unveiling, and witnessing. At the advanced level the fast has its reward in Allah Himself, the Granter of rewards. The difference between the fast of the people of tariqah and that of the people of haqiqah is that the former is a means for refining the behavior and taking on the Attributes of Allah, as the Prophet said: \"Mould your character with Allah\u2019s Attributes.\" The fast of the people of haqiqah , on the other hand, is a means of attaining annihilation and of cleansing oneself by Allah in the station of Pure Unity, which is referred to as annihilation in Unity; as Allah has said in a hadith qudsi : \"Whoever has sought Me has found Me. Whoever has found Me has come to know Me. Whoever has known Me has loved Me. Whoever has loved Me I have slain. Whomever I have slain the payment of the blood money is on Me, and I will Myself be the payment for the blood money that I owe.\" One relevant example often given is that of a lump of charcoal and fire. Suppose that there is a strong fire which is described in terms of light, burning, and heat, and that next to it lays charcoal which may be described as dark and cold. As this charcoal is gradually moved closer to the fire, we see that it begins to take on the same characteristics as the fire as fire begins to glow from the charcoal itself. Thus, the charcoal becomes fire and no longer remains charcoal. \"These parables We make for the people and they are not understood except by the wise.\" Qur'an, 29:43","title":"The Fast of Haqiqah"},{"location":"prescriptions/fasting/feast-fast-breaking/","text":"The Feast of Fast-Breaking This feast that marks the end of the month of fasting alludes to the breaking of the fast which cannot be realized as long as the seeker\u2019s senses are suppressed, for during the correct fast the senses are made redundant.

The Old Testament often refers to fasting: David chastened his soul with fasting, while Moses fasted for forty days when he ascended the mount to receive the tablets of the covenant. Daniel fasted for three weeks, supplicating and praying all the while. Jews observe six obligatory fasts during the year, one such being Yom Kippur.

Worldly Concerns The First Abstention refers to restraining the mind from being occupied with base or worldly concerns. The mind is where reasoning and intellect are developed for interaction with the world. When used properly they lead to rational and good understanding. The Prophet has taught that the contemplation of one hour is better than the actions of seventy years. 2. Useful Knowledge The Second Abstention is to use the mind and intellect to learn about creation and appropriate boundaries and limitations. \"\u2026those who preserve Allah\u2019s limits.\" Qur'an, 9:112 3. The Imagination The Third Abstention involves restraining the imaginal power. In Arabic, this is called the khay\u0101l \u2013 the faculty which enables us to construct entities or ideas which do not physically exist, such as a \u2018flying cat\u2019. During fasts, we must limit its activites to the purpose for which it was created, which is the perception of things in their true higher reality without being overcome by fantasy and foolish imagery. Allah did not create this power for any reason other than to deduce the meaning behind the world of matter. The power of imagination inspired the Pharaoh and his people to imagine that the transformation of the staff of Musa into a serpent was merely a result of magic. 4. Illusions The Fourth Abstention is restraining the power of illusion (and values or meanings given to events or situations) which makes one hate someone one minute and love someone else the next. This wahm prevents one from steadfastness and perseverance on the path of spiritual evolvement. It will cause one to fall prey to the delusion of love and hate and other confusions. Whoever possesses a \"Tranquil Soul\" is free of all of this as he is in the station of witnessing his Beloved and His acts, and \"anything the Beloved does is loved\". Whoever is in this state of witnessing One Reality has no enmity for anyone nor concern. Allah addresses the one who has attained this station: \"O soul that art at rest! Return to your Lord pleased [with Him] and well-pleasing [Him]\". Qur'an, 89:27-28 Whoever truly fasts is the one who possesses a soul that is at rest or tranquil and is not possessed or controlled by his lower self. 5. Combined Senses The Fifth Abstention deals with restraining the combined senses as they manifest themselves, both in subjective thoughts ( wahm ) and in the imagination, and as they constantly appear to the self in both form and meaning. This is naturally an obstacle to progress on the Path, because anyone who is occupied with the senses is veiled from the real significance that lies behind them. Likewise, anyone who is preoccupied with their illusions and self-given values will be veiled from true meaning. The \"One who is veiled, is veiled, regardless of whether it is by one veil or a thousand.\" Consequently, the one who fasts must abstain from the likes of these so that he may be free of all veils and witness his Beloved in the manner we have discussed. There is Only Allah The People of Allah consider the self to be like a tree with ten branches. Each branch naturally takes its share of nutrients which the tree imbibes from the earth. If, however, we suppose that nine of these branches are cut off then the power of those branches and the nutrients which originally went to them would now go to the one remaining branch; it would grow larger and its fruit would be sweeter and bigger. So it is with the self of man. If man ceases to be attached to the world which surrounds him and his attachment is to the trunk then no doubt the fruits of his thought will be loftier, greater, more powerful, and more honorable. The fast of the Gnostic consists of abstaining from witnessing anything other than Allah. Consequently, anyone fasting at this level abstains from anything other than their Beloved, for they assert that there is nothing in existence other than Allah (the Exalted), Allah\u2019s Names, Attributes and Actions; thus, everything relates to Allah, by Allah, and from Allah. This is because anybody who does not restrain his self from witnessing other than Allah is a mushrik, and the fast of the mushrik is not accepted, nor is his prayer, because praying and fasting cleanse the inner from the impurity of seeing another with Allah, and from the illusion of the grossness and the filth of \u2018otherness\u2019 with the water of Unity and the light of faith based on knowledge. It is obvious in prayer and other acts of worship that one cannot cleanse the inner unless the outer is cleansed by way of wudu or ghusl . Likewise, the fast is not valid for the mushrik, whether his shirk be open or concealed, because every mushrik rejects Reality (i.e. a k\u0101fir ) and every k\u0101fir is a mushrik , as Allah has stated: \"And whoever associates (others) with Allah has indeed gone far astray.\" Qur'an, 4:116 The following verse elucidates the meaning of concealed shirk: \"Thus whoever seeks to meet his Lord then let him do good actions and not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord.\" Qur'an, 18:110 If this is an allusion to one who was openly associating others with Allah, Allah would have said: \u2018\u2026and not associate anyone with his Lord.\u2019 But when He says \u2018in the worship of his Lord\u2019 we know that this is an allusion to one who secretly or inadvertently associates others with Allah, who are referred to as being \u2018believers\u2019 and \u2018Muslims\u2019, as Allah has said: \"And most of them do not believe in Allah without associating (others with Him).\" Qur'an, 12:106 And recall what the Prophet said: \"The infiltration of shirk into my people is more hidden than the creeping of a black ant upon a black stone on a dark night.\"","title":"Inward Abstention"},{"location":"prescriptions/fasting/inward-abstention/#inner-abstentions","text":"There are five inner abstentions:","title":"Inner abstentions"},{"location":"prescriptions/fasting/inward-abstention/#1-worldly-concerns","text":"The First Abstention refers to restraining the mind from being occupied with base or worldly concerns.

The Arabic word for fasting is derived from the root, \u2018sama\u2019, meaning to abstain from food, drink, smoking, sensual gratifications, wrong actions, harmful intentions, thoughts, words and deeds. Islamic fasting is obligatory for one month in every lunar year, that is, Ramadan, the ninth month in the Islamic calendar. All healthy adults are expected to adhere to the proper rules of fasting. In addition to this obligatory fast, there are many optional fasts, some of which occur regularly every week or month, and some that are scattered throughout the year. These fasts are Sunnah, or the practice of the Prophet. Fasting is also used as a penance for breaking an oath and as a compensation for some other religious obligation. The fast of Ramadan begins with the physical sighting of the new moon. Throughout the month a Muslim may not eat or drink from daybreak (when a fine strip of light may be seen on the horizon) until the sun has set. Before dawn a small meal ( suhur ) is usually recommended to be taken, although not obligatory, and the fast is broken just before the sunset ( maghrib ) prayer traditionally with dates and water, to be immediately followed by the prayer. Later on a larger meal is partaken by the entire family, often shared with relatives, friends and guests. The daily fast is begun by formulating the intention to perform the fast as a rite by making a clear intention (niyyah) to observe the fast. No one should fast if their health cannot sustain it or if a fast should threaten one\u2019s health. Pregnant and nursing women whose health may be harmed are exempted, as are those who are travelling away from home. When health is restored or other conditions for not fasting are removed (such as menstruation) then the person is expected to make up the fast later during the course of the year. The Opportunity of Ramadan Ramadan offers the believer an opportunity to mark an end to daily indulgences, or at least to impose clear limits on a daily basis for the duration of a month. This daily restraint breaks the habitual patterns of the self and constitutes a purification both of body and spirit, which brings about renewal of strength and greater spiritual awareness. Each and every ritualistic practice of Islam disciplines the individual and strengthens Muslim society if applied thoroughly. Every year the month of Ramadan falls at different times because the lunar calendar is shorter than the solar by approximately ten days. This means that as the period of the fast is brought forward annually, Ramadan will fall during all seasons of the year in a gradual progression. Despite the strict rules and restraint induced by the fast, Ramadan is usually a joyful time for Muslims everywhere. The last ten nights of the month, particularly the odd nights, are the spiritual highlights of Ramadan, for one of these nights is Laylat al-Qadr, the Night of Determination, in which the Qur\u2019an was first revealed to the Prophet. During these nights Muslims spend their nights in supplication and prayer, hoping to favorably influence the course of events that will unfold subsequently. Ramadan comes to a close with the celebrations and prayers of Eid al-Fitr . On this day a Muslim will give appropriate alms to the poor, and families gather for a light morning repast after the congregational prayer. The Eid prayer, usually performed outdoors is accompanied by a discourse delivered by the prayer leader after which people exchange good wishes and celebrate their success in performing a most important act of worship and attaining a heightened awareness and purposefulness in life. The Prophet of Allah said: \"The root of Islam is prayer, its branches are the obligatory tax, its height is the fast, and its expanse is striving in the way of Allah.\" He also said: \"The tax of the body is fasting.\" A Jew who was one of the most learned of his people asked the Messenger of Allah: \"Why did Allah make it obligatory upon your people to fast throughout the day for thirty days?\" The Prophet replied: \"When Adam ate from the tree it remained within his stomach for thirty days, so Allah made it obligatory upon his offspring to experience thirty days of hunger and thirst. Whatever they eat at night is a grace from Allah. Thus it was with Adam, so Allah made the same obligatory for my people.\" Then he recited the verse: \"The fast is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you.\" Qur'an, 2:183 Imam al\u2011Rida wrote the following concerning the obligation to fast: \"It is so that one may know the feeling of hunger and thirst, so that he will be humble and helpless, in order to be an indication of the difficulties of the Hereafter. Within it is contained the breaking of desires so that one will experience the deprivations caused by withholding from the poor and the needy.\" Imam al\u2011Sadiq relates that the Prophet said: \"The fast is a shield, that is, a veil protecting one from the afflictions of the world and from the punishment of the Hereafter. Thus, when you fast, make the intention to restrain your self from its desires and cut off the thoughts inspired by Shaytan. Bring yourself to the place where you are content without the desire for food or drink.\" The Degrees, Purpose, and Reason For Fasting The purpose of the fast is to deaden the desires of the self; it is a cleansing for the heart and the body and a revival of both the inner and the outer. It also includes given by those who stand in need before Allah gratitude for the grace and goodness bestowed. It increases humility, meekness, and tears, and causes one to seek refuge with Allah. The reason food is permitted during the night is because Allah does not make one responsible for more than one can endure. Allah has made it easy for us, which is the main characteristic of the shari`ah . Previously it has been said that Adam performed his fast in the daytime, that his repentance ( tawbah ) was accepted at the time of the afternoon prayer, and that he was freed of transgression at the time of the sunset prayer. This tradition is observed every day during one month so that during this time one may rid oneself of wrong actions and then be joyous in one\u2019s liberation from them by eating after sunset. The degrees of fasting can be arranged in the following manner: The first and lowest of them is that the person fasting limits himself to refraining from those things which would render his fast null and void but not from doing those things which are considered reprehensible. This is the fast of the general masses. The second is to restrain the body from whatever is considered reprehensible.

The Arabic word for fasting is derived from the root, \u2018sama\u2019, meaning to abstain from food, drink, smoking, sensual gratifications, wrong actions, harmful intentions, thoughts, words and deeds. Islamic fasting is obligatory for one month in every lunar year, that is, Ramadan, the ninth month in the Islamic calendar. All healthy adults are expected to adhere to the proper rules of fasting. In addition to this obligatory fast, there are many optional fasts, some of which occur regularly every week or month, and some that are scattered throughout the year. These fasts are Sunnah, or the practice of the Prophet. Fasting is also used as a penance for breaking an oath and as a compensation for some other religious obligation. The fast of Ramadan begins with the physical sighting of the new moon. Throughout the month a Muslim may not eat or drink from daybreak (when a fine strip of light may be seen on the horizon) until the sun has set. Before dawn a small meal ( suhur ) is usually recommended to be taken, although not obligatory, and the fast is broken just before the sunset ( maghrib ) prayer traditionally with dates and water, to be immediately followed by the prayer. Later on a larger meal is partaken by the entire family, often shared with relatives, friends and guests. The daily fast is begun by formulating the intention to perform the fast as a rite by making a clear intention (niyyah) to observe the fast. No one should fast if their health cannot sustain it or if a fast should threaten one\u2019s health. Pregnant and nursing women whose health may be harmed are exempted, as are those who are travelling away from home. When health is restored or other conditions for not fasting are removed (such as menstruation) then the person is expected to make up the fast later during the course of the year.","title":"The Islamic Fast"},{"location":"prescriptions/fasting/islamic/#the-opportunity-of-ramadan","text":"Ramadan offers the believer an opportunity to mark an end to daily indulgences, or at least to impose clear limits on a daily basis for the duration of a month. This daily restraint breaks the habitual patterns of the self and constitutes a purification both of body and spirit, which brings about renewal of strength and greater spiritual awareness. Each and every ritualistic practice of Islam disciplines the individual and strengthens Muslim society if applied thoroughly. Every year the month of Ramadan falls at different times because the lunar calendar is shorter than the solar by approximately ten days. This means that as the period of the fast is brought forward annually, Ramadan will fall during all seasons of the year in a gradual progression. Despite the strict rules and restraint induced by the fast, Ramadan is usually a joyful time for Muslims everywhere. The last ten nights of the month, particularly the odd nights, are the spiritual highlights of Ramadan, for one of these nights is Laylat al-Qadr, the Night of Determination, in which the Qur\u2019an was first revealed to the Prophet. During these nights Muslims spend their nights in supplication and prayer, hoping to favorably influence the course of events that will unfold subsequently. Ramadan comes to a close with the celebrations and prayers of Eid al-Fitr . On this day a Muslim will give appropriate alms to the poor, and families gather for a light morning repast after the congregational prayer. The Eid prayer, usually performed outdoors is accompanied by a discourse delivered by the prayer leader after which people exchange good wishes and celebrate their success in performing a most important act of worship and attaining a heightened awareness and purposefulness in life. The Prophet of Allah said: \"The root of Islam is prayer, its branches are the obligatory tax, its height is the fast, and its expanse is striving in the way of Allah.\" He also said: \"The tax of the body is fasting.\" A Jew who was one of the most learned of his people asked the Messenger of Allah: \"Why did Allah make it obligatory upon your people to fast throughout the day for thirty days?\" The Prophet replied: \"When Adam ate from the tree it remained within his stomach for thirty days, so Allah made it obligatory upon his offspring to experience thirty days of hunger and thirst. Whatever they eat at night is a grace from Allah. Thus it was with Adam, so Allah made the same obligatory for my people.\" Then he recited the verse: \"The fast is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you.\" Qur'an, 2:183 Imam al\u2011Rida wrote the following concerning the obligation to fast: \"It is so that one may know the feeling of hunger and thirst, so that he will be humble and helpless, in order to be an indication of the difficulties of the Hereafter. Within it is contained the breaking of desires so that one will experience the deprivations caused by withholding from the poor and the needy.\" Imam al\u2011Sadiq relates that the Prophet said: \"The fast is a shield, that is, a veil protecting one from the afflictions of the world and from the punishment of the Hereafter. Thus, when you fast, make the intention to restrain your self from its desires and cut off the thoughts inspired by Shaytan. Bring yourself to the place where you are content without the desire for food or drink.\"","title":"The Opportunity of Ramadan"},{"location":"prescriptions/fasting/islamic/#the-degrees-purpose-and-reason-for-fasting","text":"The purpose of the fast is to deaden the desires of the self; it is a cleansing for the heart and the body and a revival of both the inner and the outer. It also includes given by those who stand in need before Allah gratitude for the grace and goodness bestowed. It increases humility, meekness, and tears, and causes one to seek refuge with Allah. The reason food is permitted during the night is because Allah does not make one responsible for more than one can endure. Allah has made it easy for us, which is the main characteristic of the shari`ah . Previously it has been said that Adam performed his fast in the daytime, that his repentance ( tawbah ) was accepted at the time of the afternoon prayer, and that he was freed of transgression at the time of the sunset prayer. This tradition is observed every day during one month so that during this time one may rid oneself of wrong actions and then be joyous in one\u2019s liberation from them by eating after sunset. The degrees of fasting can be arranged in the following manner: The first and lowest of them is that the person fasting limits himself to refraining from those things which would render his fast null and void but not from doing those things which are considered reprehensible. This is the fast of the general masses. The second is to restrain the body from whatever is considered reprehensible. Consequently, one guards his tongue against slander, his eyes against desire, and so on with the rest of his body. This represents the fast of the people of tariqah . The third, in addition to the above, is to protect the heart from going astray and from the whisperings of Shaytan, limiting it to the Remembrance of Allah and the witnessing of Him in all His manifestations.

Among the stipulations in Islam is the soundness of the intention covering a specific time period, for example, the month of Ramadan, or for the purpose of fulfilling an oath ( nadhar ). The intention which specifies the type of fast must also be made at the time when it is begun. There are various categories of fasts and each has its particular regulations: obligatory fasts, recommended fasts, fasts for specific oaths, and fasts for non\u2011specific oaths. Those actions which require a fast to be made up ( qada\u2019 ) or expiated ( kaff\u0101rah ) are nine in number and are as follows (as per the teachings of Ahl ul-Bayt): Eating. Drinking. Sexual intercourse. Intentional ejaculation. Intentionally telling a lie concerning Allah, His Messenger, or the Imams. Complete submersion in water. Intentionally taking in thick dust in the throat (e.g. flour or anything similar). Intentionally remaining in a state of jan\u0101bah (ritual impurity) until after fajr. Going back to sleep after having already awakened before fajr. The kaff\u0101rah or expiation consists of fasting for two consecutive months, or feeding sixty people in need, or freeing a slave (this ruling remains even though slavery is no longer practiced, while the more likely practice will be the two former). One may choose one of the above. Actions to Refrain From There are eight actions which will break the fast and will require the Muslim to make up a fast without expiation: Eating, drinking, or engaging in sexual intercourse before confirming whether or not it is actually sunrise. Not accepting it when someone (reliable) says that it is sunrise. Following someone else who says that it is not yet sunrise when one is able to observe it oneself that it is indeed already sunrise. Following someone else who says it is night when one is able to ascertain it oneself. Breaking the fast (ift\u0101r) before its time has arrived; e.g. when in the presence of some obstruction (such as clouds) in the sky which makes it appear to be dark, and then it becomes clear that it is not yet the time of ift\u0101r . Returning to sleep after having already awakened once before taking a ritual bath from jan\u0101bah and not awakening again until after the sun has risen. Water entering the throat for those seeking to cool themselves (but this does not include the rinsing of the mouth in preparation for prayer) Finally, taking an enema. For the more mature Muslim, fasting means to abstain from anything which would be displeasing to their Lord and contrary to His commandment and prohibition, either in word or deed. The Messenger of Allah said: \"Everything has a door and the door to acts of devotion is fasting.\" Guidance for Seekers The more advanced seeker abstains from whatever is forbidden and restrains the self. Fasting is a deep link between the seeker and his Lord which no one observes but Allah, in contrast to prayer, the obligatory tax, and the various other actions which are possible for others to notice (and therefore possibly motivated by the desire for acclaim or out of pride). \"Whoever wants to meet his Lord, then let him perform good actions and not see anything other than Allah in the worship of his Lord.\" [18:110] Seeing other than Allah (shirk) in this context refers to performing an act of worship for the eyes of someone other than Allah. The Prophet said: \"The infiltration of shirk within my people is more hidden than the creeping of a black ant on a black stone on a dark night.\" Islamic scholars say that this type of shirk refers to the performance of an act of worship for one\u2019s own reputation of piety or other worldly position. The men of inner knowledge say that it means \u2018to see anything other than the One\u2019, as Imam `Ali has said: \"The lowest form of riy\u0101\u2019 (worship performed to be seen by other than Allah) is shirk.\" There is no question of riy\u0101\u2019 if one sees no one but Allah. Open or hidden shirk will inevitably be weakened by cutting back desires and appetites, as Imam `Ali said: \"Shaytan flows through man like blood so constrict his passageways by hunger.\" The Messenger of Allah said: \"The gates of the garden are opened when Ramadan begins and the gates of the Fire are closed.\"","title":"Meaning and Benefits"},{"location":"prescriptions/fasting/meaning-benefits/#the-meaning-and-benefits-of-fasting","text":"To fast is to refrain from specific things during certain specified intervals of time.

Abstention of the Tongue This concerns useless, foolish, or discourteous speech, as well as anything which would be contrary to what pleases Allah.

Divine knowledge is to be tasted and witnessed personally and the tongue is incapable of expressing what is beyond the senses and the mind. The Messenger of Allah said: \"Whoever speaks too much speaks frivolously. Whoever speaks frivolously has little modesty. Whoever has little modesty has little restraint, and whoever has little restraint enters the Fire.\" 2. Abstention of the Eyes This involves restraining them from seeing whatever is forbidden according to the shari`ah of Islam. \"Tell the people of faith to avert their eyes and to guard their private parts.\" Qur'an, 24:30 Lowering the gaze is expected from the serious seeker. Desires that arise from seeing can cause distractions that can be subtle and subconscious as well as gross and action-oriented. A blind person may be spared these distractions (unless he or she regains his/her sight). 3. Abstention of the Ears The ears must be restrained from hearing whatever is forbidden in shari`ah, like slander and gossip, music and songs that entice lower tendencies, and listening to the talk of the misguided and the corrupt. 4. Abstention of the Sense of Smell This refers to abstaining from both foul odours as well as exciting scents. Foul odours cause aversion and disgust, whereas sweet scent may excite desires and pleasures. 5. Abstention of the Sense of Taste The meaning here relates to avoidance of whatever may veil the faculty of reason, such as imbibing intoxicating beverages, or by acquiring a taste for usury and unfair profit, abuse of orphans, the poor and the weak, and various other \u2018prohibitive\u2019 tastes and habits which will hinder one\u2019s spiritual progress. \"And do not approach the property of the orphan except in the best manner.\" Qur'an, 6:152 \"But those who take usury will rise up on the Day of Resurrection like someone tormented by Satan\u2019s touch.\" Qur'an, 2:275 6. Abstention of the Sense of Touch This relates to abstaining from touching whatever may lead to forbidden actions, or to excesses in permitted actions, or to go beyond the limits of balance. \"They will say to their skins, \u201cwhy have you testified against us?\u201d They will reply: \u201cAllah has caused us to speak, it is He who gives speech to everything and He created you in the first instance and to Him you will return.\" Qur'an, 41:21 \"Nor were you discreet lest your ears or your eyes or your skins testify against you.\" Qur'an, 41:22 The senses have been created to function in harmony and balance regarding worldly interactions. Anyone who uses the body and its various parts in a manner for which it was not created is considered to be a wrongdoer and out of balance, which is the opposite of harmony, and, therefore, of justice. One explanation of the following verse: \"And the places of prostration (mas\u0101jid) are for Allah, so therefore do not call upon anyone with Allah\" Qur'an, 72:18 is that the human points of prostration include the seven points where the physical body touches the ground.

To get a fuller perspective than what is provided below, please read the book, \" Transformative Worship in Islam: Experiencing Perfection \". Stillness Generally there are three stages in the practice of stillness in body, mind, and heart. 1. Preparation and Intention This preliminary stage is intended to help you overcome the natural mental noise that goes on in your head. Anything that exists seeks to perpetuate itself. All thoughts are froth from the neuron circuitry, so allow them to exhaust themselves and leave you. Ensure that the possibilities for being interrupted are kept to a minimum and that your attention is not diverted to worldly needs. As you do your wudu concentrate on the meaning of every movement, using each one as an opportunity to purify the decaying body (see Transformative Worship for more on this). Sound is a powerful tool when used repetitively as a way of tricking the mind through self-hypnosis to reduce the circling of thoughts and bring them to one point. It is not so much the intensity of being mindful but the frequency and constancy. This approach incorporates any of a dozen methodologies or ways. Recitation of Qur\u2019an Sit quietly and follow a recitation or read aloud yourself. Repeat only a few ayat of your choice. Dhikr This is an opportunity to leave behind your identity, your biography, your worries. Choose a dhikr that is effective for you. Recite the Name \u2018Allah\u2019 in any fashion, or any other Divines Names. For example, if you are ill \u2018Ya Sh\u0101f\u012b Ya Mu\u2019\u0101f\u012b\u2019 may be helpful; if worried for provisions, \u2018Ya Fatt\u0101h Ya Razz\u0101q\u2018. Visualisation Visualize anything you are comfortable and familiar with, such as a divine name on the horizon, a colour, rainbows etc. Whatever you choose, concentrate on it. For example, take a rose in your hand and ask it permission to de-petal it. Your mind is a trickster; you have to outwit it. Breath Become aware of inhaling and exhaling, extending the period of exhalation. 2. Entering the Ocean The moment you have made your intention you are on the shore wading in, in the hope that the sea will engulf you and that you will lose all self-consciousness, self-awareness and identity. In Muslim cultures, certain terms were used to denote meditative retreats, such as khalwa (which connotes a status and prestige that is quite misplaced and abused in this day and age), i\u2019tik\u0101f (which has remained a tradition practised during the last 10 days of Ramadan) and \u2018uzla (a more neutral term denoting setting oneself aside). Whilst wading through the shallows, many aspects of the self will be revealed to you. Allow them to emerge, face them with courage, and allow them to exhaust themselves. When dealing with aspects of your shadow, it is useful to imagine that you are in the guesthouse described by Rumi, welcoming each without judgement, and then eventually watching them recede. Persist and be patient and do not judge your progress because this zone takes the bulk of energy and time. 3. Transcending Space and Time As you are wading, there may be occasions when you slip or lose your foothold; do not panic but be patient. Now you are approaching the deep end: experiencing different qualities of silence. Flow with that state with trust but no fear. You are now entering a zone of higher consciousness that is at the edge of truth. All these approaches will help move you along towards higher consciousness. The Origin Ultimately, we're seeking the origin for everything. How did it come about? How did an insect evolve to become what it is? What is the origin of an idea? How did the notion of God come about? What is the origin of life? Who am I descended from? Maybe there was a great being or hero among my ancestors. Perhaps that is why I feel special! We want to identify with power, honour and glory. This quest is within conditioned consciousness. What, however, is the origin of the seed of questing origin?

Anything that exists seeks to perpetuate itself. All thoughts are froth from the neuron circuitry, so allow them to exhaust themselves and leave you. Ensure that the possibilities for being interrupted are kept to a minimum and that your attention is not diverted to worldly needs. As you do your wudu concentrate on the meaning of every movement, using each one as an opportunity to purify the decaying body (see Transformative Worship for more on this). Sound is a powerful tool when used repetitively as a way of tricking the mind through self-hypnosis to reduce the circling of thoughts and bring them to one point. It is not so much the intensity of being mindful but the frequency and constancy. This approach incorporates any of a dozen methodologies or ways. Recitation of Qur\u2019an Sit quietly and follow a recitation or read aloud yourself. Repeat only a few ayat of your choice. Dhikr This is an opportunity to leave behind your identity, your biography, your worries. Choose a dhikr that is effective for you. Recite the Name \u2018Allah\u2019 in any fashion, or any other Divines Names. For example, if you are ill \u2018Ya Sh\u0101f\u012b Ya Mu\u2019\u0101f\u012b\u2019 may be helpful; if worried for provisions, \u2018Ya Fatt\u0101h Ya Razz\u0101q\u2018. Visualisation Visualize anything you are comfortable and familiar with, such as a divine name on the horizon, a colour, rainbows etc. Whatever you choose, concentrate on it. For example, take a rose in your hand and ask it permission to de-petal it. Your mind is a trickster; you have to outwit it.

In Muslim cultures, certain terms were used to denote meditative retreats, such as khalwa (which connotes a status and prestige that is quite misplaced and abused in this day and age), i\u2019tik\u0101f (which has remained a tradition practised during the last 10 days of Ramadan) and \u2018uzla (a more neutral term denoting setting oneself aside). Whilst wading through the shallows, many aspects of the self will be revealed to you. Allow them to emerge, face them with courage, and allow them to exhaust themselves. When dealing with aspects of your shadow, it is useful to imagine that you are in the guesthouse described by Rumi, welcoming each without judgement, and then eventually watching them recede.

If there is a purpose in life it is to know that life is eternal and intrinisically utterly perfect , irrespective of short term human perception. The prophetic revelations emphasize the need for human beings to accept responsibility for their intentions and actions and to willfully desire higher levels of consciousness and insight, i.e. knowledge of God.

Real personal development of this knowledge relates directly to sincerity, trust and certainty. The result is conscious awareness of Allah at all times and in all circumstances. This God consciousness is referred to as taqwa in Islam, which puts an emphasis on attaining it through dhikr : remembrance and awareness of this primary and ultimate light within us, the source of self-awareness. Being in constant reference to this Supreme Consciousness enables us to put into perspective all other changing states that we experience in life. The Two Spheres Human consciousness has two levels or spheres of awareness: The personal, local or conditioned consciousness The boundless, pure consciousness that enables us to go beyond the limitations of local awareness. The 'fall' of Adam from paradise can be regarded as the force that propels his offspring to seek eternal perfection through higher consciousness. The Qur'an's description of human life as a gift, or 'loaned trust' implies a pure consciousness that is boundless and eternal, a sacred relization or presence. Muslims often refer to this sacred tradition ( hadith qudsi ) of the Prophet (pbuh): The shari`ah is my words, tariqah my actions, and haqiqah my state. Understanding is my capital, reason ( `aql ) the basis of my way of life ( d\u012bn ), and love my foundation; longing is my mount, fear my companion, and knowledge my weapon; forbearance is my master, trust in Allah my helper, and contentment my treasure; truthfulness is my stopping place, certainty my shelter, poverty my pride, and by it I am honoured over all Prophets and Messengers. Experiencing Perfection Human beings are driven to higher consciousness by prayer, meditation and a host of creative pursuits such as the arts, music and other transcendental activities, all of which reflect our yearning to return to a blissful state of contented happiness - paradise. It is ultimately supreme consciousness that we all desire, here and now. All acts of worhsip begin with self-awareness and a desire for higher knowledge. The preparation for worship is the declaration of intent and the hope to be focussed, attentive and engaged in the process of deepening one's state of awareness. A point may arrive when the worshiper loses concerns with worldly mundane matters and begins to experience subtler levels of awareness which are deeper than the normal day to day variety. The ultimate purpose of worship and prayer is to realize experientially a state that is not subject to earthly or mental limitations. This may be variously identified as the sacred void, inner bliss, pure peace, or ultimate or higher consciousness. Tawhid Islam is founded upon experiential tawh\u012bd . The whole universe has emanated from one source and appears in infinite levels and layers of dualities, diversities, complementarities, competitions, cooperation and other forces.

For more detailed descriptions of actual practices, and for your own deeper understanding and insight, please refer to the entire book . Body, Mind and Heart Well-being of body, mind and heart are essential for spiritual growth and unison between self and soul. The body is like a temple: for an aspiring worshipper, its health and efficiency are important. The danger comes from being infatuated with a beautiful temple rather than divine beauty itself. For the seasoned seeker, the entire earth is a temple. Thus, a holistic life for individuals, as well as for society, implies outer health in order to pursue inner health, harmony and contentment. Commitment to a path and appropriate spiritual practices are essential if the self is to unite with its soul-mate and bask in God\u2019s eternal grace and mercy. Worship initially satisfies the need to attempt an escape from undesirable situations, mindsets or behavior. Then worship becomes the mode of life, as it brings the person closer to witnessing perfections. To live by grace and divine presence is to be in awe at all times and be in the grip of the miraculous divine light with its visible appearances and its boundless domains. Mindfulness Mindfulness, groomed, developed and fully evolved will lead to mindlessness and heart-fullness. A clear mind is necessary but insufficient, for it is the heart that knows the truth. If the self is to read the heart, it first needs to be distracted from the shadows of egotistical self interest, so as to connect with the heart. You can only taste honey after spitting out the bitter aloe in your mouth. The immortal soul beams its numerous lights on the entire human kingdom, with its complex physiology and cosmology. The soul contains the foundations of everything that is understandable; its role is fulfilled when the self is aligned with it. When this harmony between the self, body, mind, heart and soul is established, the map of human composition is internalized, lived efficiently and the seeker reaches the intended destiny of witnessing perfection joyfully. Reading the map with urgent attention and then following its codes of transformation will bring about unity with the perfect destination. Witnessing Perfection As personal human consciousness evolves soul consciousness provides the stable background behind the changes, for the soul is linked to the non-space-time dimension. When consciousness is unified, perfection is witnessed at all times. When the body is well and relaxed and the mind is still, a moment of joyfulness may be experienced spontaneously without any discernible reason. In such a state, time seems to have stopped or to be moving smoothly. Concern for the future and sorrows from the past are forgotten. When the heart is content, the self expresses a moment of perfect harmony and peace. At such an instant personal consciousness is in unison with soul consciousness and the self experiences harmony and a glow of well-being. To witness perfection, all levels of consciousness need to relate smoothly and harmoniously. If happiness and contentment is the main purpose in life, then entry is through the door of experiencing and witnessing inner perfections. The human desire for outer success and excellence is only an aspect of aiming to realize the perfect moment. We sometimes succeed in worldly activity and at other times we fail. Pleasure through success is simply reflecting the experience of momentary outer unity and harmony. Even with failure, the events themselves have followed a perfect pattern of cause and effect, irrespective of the final result. There is, however, a danger that the spiritual seeker may develop a cynical or careless attitude towards outcomes. When someone expresses a lack of worldly interest and claims that outer success does not really matter, the heart may still harbor a secret desire or fear in that direction. There is a big difference between hoping for something and acting towards that end, and not hoping or acting, yet having a hidden desire. Witnessing perfections at all times implies seeing the outer and inner worlds with the soul\u2019s lens, not with the mind or self. Reflections of Perfection The purified heart reflects the light of the perfect creator as it falls upon the receptive human self. Everything in creation reflects, to a certain extent, an aspect of the numerous qualities of god. Every color of the rainbow is produced by the original colorless light. The creator\u2019s attributes are etched within the human soul and are sought after by the self. These qualities are also ingrained within other souls in creation to varying degrees. The lion was worshipped for power and dominance and the ant for selfless cooperation and collective survival. These attributes are universally regarded as virtues worthy to be pursued; likewise their absence or opposite qualities are vices to be avoided. Patience and impatience, like all binary opposites, co-exist as a matter of creational law. All shadows are proof of the light, which causes them. Every sentient creation has been touched by a spark of the perfect creator through consciousness at various levels. Thus, everything in existence resonates with an aspect of the creator\u2019s perfections, or its opposite, at any one time. Perfections are reflections of god\u2019s attributes. We experience aspects of them and desire them. The soul contains god\u2019s qualities and beams them out towards the self.","title":"Witnessing Perfection"},{"location":"prescriptions/practice/witnessing-perfection/#witnessing-perfection","text":"This article contains a brief series of excerpts from the book \"Witnessing Perfection\", which detail the specifically Islamic notion of \"witnessing\" (or shahada in Arabic), and how this can lead one to realizing the perfection of each and every moment.

When someone expresses a lack of worldly interest and claims that outer success does not really matter, the heart may still harbor a secret desire or fear in that direction. There is a big difference between hoping for something and acting towards that end, and not hoping or acting, yet having a hidden desire. Witnessing perfections at all times implies seeing the outer and inner worlds with the soul\u2019s lens, not with the mind or self.","title":"Witnessing Perfection"},{"location":"prescriptions/practice/witnessing-perfection/#reflections-of-perfection","text":"The purified heart reflects the light of the perfect creator as it falls upon the receptive human self. Everything in creation reflects, to a certain extent, an aspect of the numerous qualities of god. Every color of the rainbow is produced by the original colorless light. The creator\u2019s attributes are etched within the human soul and are sought after by the self. These qualities are also ingrained within other souls in creation to varying degrees. The lion was worshipped for power and dominance and the ant for selfless cooperation and collective survival. These attributes are universally regarded as virtues worthy to be pursued; likewise their absence or opposite qualities are vices to be avoided. Patience and impatience, like all binary opposites, co-exist as a matter of creational law. All shadows are proof of the light, which causes them. Every sentient creation has been touched by a spark of the perfect creator through consciousness at various levels. Thus, everything in existence resonates with an aspect of the creator\u2019s perfections, or its opposite, at any one time. Perfections are reflections of god\u2019s attributes. We experience aspects of them and desire them. The soul contains god\u2019s qualities and beams them out towards the self.","title":"Reflections of Perfection"},{"location":"videos/","text":"Videos Emptying Start here...

While it is not possible to summarise his work in four simple videos, each one of these illustrates a key tenet of the teaching. The three basic pillars of Islam (surrender, submission, acceptance), Iman (trust, faith) and Ihsan (contentment, excellence) will reveal the need to learn how to conduct one's self properly. Being correct and courteous in all of one's outer actions naturally leads one to begin questioning some of the inner meanings so-called correct conduct is based upon. Questioning these is not actually a matter of faith, but of a certain kind of knowing that grows from seeing yourself, your thoughts, and your actions within the wider framework of what the Shaykh often calls \"The Three C's\" - connection, continuity and consciousness. This most useful and broad map, when applied with awareness and understanding, can lead one to experience differentiated sameness in every perfect moment: seeing everywhere the multiple faces of One God. Islam, Iman, Ihsan Watch Self Conduct Watch Connection, Continuity, Consciousness Watch Differentiated Sameness Watch The Spiritual Path We often search for what is labelled as Truth, God, Reality or The One. People who adhere to specific religions or paths consider theirs to be superior to others, even though there may be as many ways to God as there are human beings. The illusion of separation is the cause of all ignorance. The quest and need for a path arises due to the illusory experience of a separate identity and personal point of view. Many search for a path to the Divine, though few seem to find one which is durable, sustainable and can serve as a container capable of bearing them along the entire distance they must travel (while revealing that distance to be just another illusion!). A tried and tested truth, though, is that more the nafs is restricted, the narrower the path becomes and the brighter the light of the soul. Everyone is on a path, whether consciously or unconsciously. The important thing is to have a trustworthy reference. On a jagged path, that reference will bring you back to easy passage. Then you are more efficient in realizing presence, uniting the visible and invisible, and returning to One. Part 1 Watch Part 2 Watch Part 3 Watch Part 4 Watch Part 5 Watch The Importance of Choosing a Path Watch What is Presence? Watch Live Fully Knowing You Will Die Watch What Can You Control? Will, desire and ability are key forces in our life and quest for connectedness and continuity. We live according to what is within our domain to change or control. A child expresses anger and disappointment due to failure or the inability to achieve what they desire. God\u2019s agent within us, our Soul, controls our life and its shadow image, self or ego. Yet the self falls into the illusion of control and ownership \u2013 this is my dog, my house or my cousin. When did these controls come about and for how long? The dog is a living entity with its own nature. We can only exercise some control with limited certainty. As long as anything moves, its destiny and existence are uncertain. Nature provided a suitable environment for life and consciousness to emerge within the confines of the womb of space and time - that is the history of life on earth. However that limited cosnciousness is charged by permanent consciousness, by sacred beingness . From this emerges a short-lived human life dependent always on eternal life. All is under Soul-control, but we are veiled by the ability to move and change. You can close the door or leave it open. You can leave this place or not. Speak or be silent. Limited, limited, limited. We are given a tiny opening to visualize the infinite, self-propelled universe, which is under perfect governance at all times. Human life is like a waiting room before we perceive the reality of perfect control, by One who permeates it all. Personality Watch Parenthood Watch Islam and Science Watch What is the Meaning of Life? Watch Who Am I? Watch God Is With You, Wherever You Are Watch Insight, The Soul and Calibration We often experience disappointment and frustrations. We also too often feel trapped, confused or lost. Why are we constantly faced with these challenges? This is due to the limitations of conditioned consciousness and ego. Between birth and death, we play roles in this shadow theatre of life, as we evolve towards our origin. Frustrations arise out of the disparity between our higher Soul consciousness and the shadow self. How can we refer and calibrate our perceived experience with the constancy of the soul? It is helpful to have a role model, and more helpful to have a trusted teacher who reflects higher consciousness. The zone of higher consciousness is infinite and beyond all descriptions like joy, bliss or happiness. A good example of how to move to higher consciousness is riding a bicycle. You are put on the saddle and somebody pushes you. After a while you learn to balance and you feel you can repeat it on your own. Similarly, you first need a map of Reality, and you then follow the path that may lead to your destination. Determination and grace are required to awaken to your Soul. It is when you experience that ever-present Reality, you know that your old self was merely a shadow, of the Real. When you transcend your tyrannical or feral self, you perceive that its role was to cause that suffering and thereby act as a prelude for awakening. Your lower self leads you to your real self \u2013 the divine spirit within. Life on earth is a struggle because it is a realm of experience between limitations and limitless Reality.

If you delay you will become fossilized and it will be more difficult.

It is the extent of discernibility of these connections and forces that is sought by us. The newly born baby connects with its mother. After a few weeks emotions develop; eye contact and feelings bring about deeper connections. With maturity; subtler senses, feelings and connections develop. Consciousness of connections originates from our soul within the heart and takes physical chemical, intellectual and other dimensions.

Much human effort is expended to reduce distance and separation. As for time, we try to go faster than all possibilities or, more effectively, to stop time altogether. Our human conditioned consciousness drives us towards stillness in mind, which opens the door of timelessness and perpetual presence. All human endeavours lead to a point of experience, which occurs when the mind is content and still. The moment of success or heightened pleasure reflects this state.

We enjoy the changing seasons and excitement of uncertainty, but our main quest is for what is reliable and constant. A relationship that connects human excitement and stimulation with spiritual stability and tranquillity is a durable relationship. There are endless levels of realities and the higher points are near the origin of what is constant and perpetual. Whatever reminds us of the ever-present is generally a desirable state.

I prayed for inspiration, and that night had a wonderful dream. There was a fine black tent, stretching towards the horizon. I was taken inside and saw the Prophet (pbuh) and his family scattered in different parts of the tent. Imam Ali beckoned to me and said, \u2018You wanted to talk to my sons, and here they are.\u2019 Both Imam Hassan and Imam Hussein appeared, as young men, cheerfully exchanging pleasantries. I cautiously approached Imam Hussein and asked, \u2018Do I have your permission to talk about your martyrdom?\u2019 \u2018Of course you can\u2019, he replied, \u2018but only if you depict me as you see me now; in perfect joy, in timeless bliss \u2013 not in any other way.\u2019 From \" Son of Karbala \u2013 The Spiritual Journey of an Iraqi Muslim \" Now \u2013 The Gateway of Eternity Allah\u2019s protection and care is forever covering us. It is only we who go to the past and resurrect the dead. That is why the true mu\u2019min regrets at the time, asks Allah\u2019s forgiveness and moves on. We don\u2019t constantly go and visit the scene of the crime. Expect the best of Allah and remember that one of His qualities as it is described in the Qur\u2019an is al-\u2018Afuw . It is from the word \u2018af\u0101 . It means effacing, obliterating, or wiping out, and hence, to pardon. From the same root \u2018afuw comes \u2018\u0101fiyah , meaning wellbeing. The past doesn\u2019t exist anymore because time, in reality, doesn\u2019t exist. It is only as part of His \u2018catchment\u2019, so that we are in time and space yearning for non-time and non-space. Though in reality the past does not exist, we are the product of it. Insofar as we are the evidence it is relevant, but no more. The rest is mental sickness and the emotional stupidity of going back and forth in time \u2013 which robs us of presence. That is why one of the main conditions of a sal\u0101t that truly energizes us is hud\u016br (presence) of our hearts.

In order to properly introduce these talks, we suggest you spend some time reflecting on the following excerpts from some of the Shaykh's books so that you can absorb more fully everything the Shaykh covers in the talks that follow. Resolving the Paradox Light and other forms of energy and matter are caught within the confines of time and space. The mystery of life and creation can be traced at the boundaries of space and time and in the original and ever-present sacred void. The human tendency of wanting to stretch a good time eternally or to stop a \u2018bad\u2019 time instantly echoes the quest to break out of space-time limitations. It is natural for conditioned consciousness to lead to what is past worldly limitations to the zone of transcendental pure consciousness. The healthy seeker connects all aspects of relative sensation to the timeless state of inner perception, the soul\u2019s insight or Divine light. \u201cHe grants wisdom to whom He pleases, and whoever is granted wisdom, he indeed is given abundant goodness \u2026..\u201d (2:269) Another paradox in human experience is that of the old and the new. The timeless and that which is within time are never separate since the absolute and the relative always resonate together. We seek the most old and ancient, as well as that which is \u2018now\u2019, fresh and new. Both of these time-related ideas disappear when we catch a glimpse of the eternally perfect instant. This is why it is said that there is no merit in abstentions, unless they lead to spiritual awakening. The death of the ego is the birth of the enlightened self \u2013 a new life.

The mystery of life and creation can be traced at the boundaries of space and time and in the original and ever-present sacred void. The human tendency of wanting to stretch a good time eternally or to stop a \u2018bad\u2019 time instantly echoes the quest to break out of space-time limitations. It is natural for conditioned consciousness to lead to what is past worldly limitations to the zone of transcendental pure consciousness. The healthy seeker connects all aspects of relative sensation to the timeless state of inner perception, the soul\u2019s insight or Divine light. \u201cHe grants wisdom to whom He pleases, and whoever is granted wisdom, he indeed is given abundant goodness \u2026..\u201d (2:269) Another paradox in human experience is that of the old and the new. The timeless and that which is within time are never separate since the absolute and the relative always resonate together. We seek the most old and ancient, as well as that which is \u2018now\u2019, fresh and new. Both of these time-related ideas disappear when we catch a glimpse of the eternally perfect instant. This is why it is said that there is no merit in abstentions, unless they lead to spiritual awakening. The death of the ego is the birth of the enlightened self \u2013 a new life.

In order to introduce this section properly, please reflect on these three excerpts from Shaykh Fadhlalla's more recent book, \" Witnessing Perfection \": Information and Transformation \"Human growth and evolvement is enhanced as we respond to facts and information by reference to rationality as well as higher consciousness.\" Personal consciousness evolves when the senses, mind and body interact with the outer world and \u2018make sense\u2019 out of events and situations. The mind develops by investigating cause and effect, and the connection between new experiences and events with past memory and knowledge. The self needs to exchange news and information, transmit and receive feelings and evaluations, in order to evolve further in consciousness. The human urge to push the boundaries of possibilities further into the unknown is constant. The \u2018sky is the limit\u2019 is a natural human tendency, for we are both earthly (limited in personal consciousness) and heavenly (boundless pure consciousness). Thus, the sky is not the limit; it is the prelude to higher and endless \u2018skies\u2019. Today\u2019s vast quantities of available information present a challenge and opportunity as to how best to utilise this wealth of data and information for the sake of inner transformation. Transformation implies transcending self images, the rational mind and the discernable world towards pure consciousness, beyond all specific, tangible realities and experience. This drive motivates the search for perfection in all worldly situations but it is frustrating at the same time, for our natural world is subject to change and unpredictability. Thus we seek perfection always (where the state of the soul is) and can never attain it for any duration. Personal suffering is the result of distractions in the self\u2019s hesitant progress towards inner realization, fulfilment and contentment. The self always desires states and experiences that are not realistic or sustainable in the changing world of space-time. Every self innately aspires for the qualities of the soul and thus can only be content after submitting to the soul\u2019s boundless light and higher consciousness. Freedom, as such, is a by-product of unity between the head and heart, self and soul. The soul is ever free and the self is ever restless in its search. \"It is a wise one who is always hopeful to learn meanings and lessons from difficulties and hardships.\" If We Are Willing To Stop Human beings reflect the cosmic perfection at the point of conception but, as we grow errors and defects become prominent with increased entropy. Our apparent freedom of action only increases our imperfections. \u2018And time must have an end\u2019 is the ultimate and just remedy for all earthly endeavours. If we are willing to stop, our chances of an appropriate start are greater. When the stop/start frequency resonates within head and heart, the \u2018self and soul connection\u2019 is stronger. Unity in consciousness is the fruit of spiritual evolvement which encompasses the seen and unseen worlds. There is None Except One The disciple declared that there are countless beings in existence, but the master insisted that there is none except One. He then reminded the student that when you truly open your eyes many may appear within your sight, whereas in truth these are only shadows of the everlasting one light within them, before them and after them. The master then sang: \"Passion for God has bewildered me; thus I am alien and a stranger in this world.

Before watching the talks, we recommend you spend some time reflecting on the following excerpts from some of the Shaykh's books. The Evolving Self Every human soul contains the essence of all creation and their meaning. The individual self evolves in consciousness as it experiences creational events and aspires towards the soul\u2019s perfection and its freedom from space-time limitations. When self and soul unite at heart, a person experiences a degree of wholeness and contentment in life. The soul transmits pure consciousness and multitudes of admirable attributes, giving hope and purpose to the self. The self of every being is different \u2013 specific \u2013 and evolves towards the soul. Personal consciousness and the state of body, mind and heart, grow and evolve through life\u2019s experiences towards the soul and higher consciousness. The groomed and mature self submits to the soul and experiences unison and contentment. Birth, growth, maturity and death are all activities relating to the self and its material identification along the journey, which starts with one cell growing into a most complex human being. Upon death the self departs from the physical world along with the soul. The evolving self experiences diverse states until it attains the soul\u2019s universal essence. The self\u2019s enlightenment comes with the recognition of its total dependence on, adoration and love of the soul and its creator; the unique everlasting one, who can only be known through his great qualities and created dualities. The achievement of harmonious alignment between self and soul is the ultimate purpose of human life. The journey begins with the self\u2019s identification with the body and mind and ends in its union at heart with its soul. The self always seeks stimulus, thrill and new discoveries which are all superseded by increased awareness of the perfect moment. Spiritual Logic and Worldly Logic What is bounded, restricted and delineated is complementary to the boundless and limitless. Infinity is rooted in the tiny entity of an electron or photon. To restrict the self is the first step towards the open horizons of the soul. Many spiritual practices and religions establish laws and boundaries without a clear outer logic or reason, for spiritual logic is totally different to the worldly version. Here you go against the self and its desire where normally you simply try to please the self without reliable satisfaction.
